Please assist in devising a week-long travel plan for a party of 5. We will depart from Marquette with the aim of visiting 3 cities in Michigan between March 6th and March 12th, 2022. Our budget is now set at $14,600. We should emphasize that our accommodations must be suitable for children under 10.
