Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. First, I'll read through the provided text carefully.

The text mentions a 5-day itinerary for a group of 3 starting in Miami and visiting two cities in Texas. The travel dates are from March 27th to March 31st, 2022, with a budget of $8,500. They also want to experience Indian and Mediterranean cuisines.

Looking at the JSON structure examples, I need to map each piece of information correctly. "org" is Miami, "dest" is Texas, and "days" is 5. Since days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" should be 2. The dates will be an array from March 27th to 31st.

The group consists of 3 people, so "people_number" is 3, and the budget is $8,500. For local constraints, they mentioned cuisine preferences: Indian and Mediterranean. House rules, room type, and transportation aren't specified, so those will be null.

I should ensure that all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated to be null. Also, check if any other constraints like house rules or transportation were mentioned but in this case, they weren't. So the JSON should reflect only the cuisine preferences under local constraints.
