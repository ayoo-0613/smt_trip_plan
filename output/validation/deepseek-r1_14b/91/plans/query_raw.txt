Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 5-day travel plan for three people departing from Omaha and visiting two cities in Michigan. The dates are March 19th to March 23rd, 2022, with a budget of $7,500. They require private rooms for accommodation.

Starting with the basics: "org" is Omaha, "dest" is Michigan, and "days" is 5. Since days exceed 3, I need to note that they're visiting two cities in Michigan, so "visiting_city_number" is 2.

Next, the dates are from March 19th to 23rd. I'll format these into an array of strings with the YYYY-MM-DD format: ["2022-03-19", "2022-03-20", ..., "2022-03-23"].

The number of people is clearly stated as 3, so "people_number" is 3. The budget is $7,500, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

Now, looking at local constraints: house rule isn't mentioned, so it's null. Cuisine isn't specified either, so that's null too. However, they require private rooms, which falls under "room type". The transportation constraint is about not self-driving, but since they didn't mention flights or other options, I'll set "transportation" to null.

I need to ensure all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated to be null. So the JSON structure will include all necessary keys with appropriate values and nulls where needed.
