Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions for a travel plan problem. The user provided examples that outline how to structure these steps, so I'll follow those closely.

First, let me parse the query:

- **Duration**: 5 days (March 19th to March 23rd, 2022)
- **Group Size**: 3 people
- **Departure City**: Omaha
- **Destination**: 2 cities in Michigan
- **Budget**: $7,500
- **Accommodation Requirements**: Private rooms

Looking at the examples, each step is broken down into sections like Destination Cities, Departure Dates, Transportation Methods, etc. I'll need to create similar sections.

Starting with **Destination Cities**, since they're visiting 2 cities in Michigan, I'll set up a list of these cities and loop through them as per the examples.

Next, **Departure Dates** will involve setting variables for each transportation leg (from Omaha to city1 and city1 to city2) and ensuring the dates align with the travel period.

For **Transportation Methods**, since they don't want flights, I'll set all methods to self-driving or taxi. The examples show how to assert that no flights are used.

Then, I'll handle each component: **Flight Information** (though in this case, it's not needed), **Driving Information**, **Restaurant Information**, **Attraction Information**, and **Accommodation Information**. Each section will involve searching for relevant data and setting up variables with constraints based on the query.

Finally, the **Budget** section will sum up all expenses from transportation, restaurants, attractions, and accommodations to ensure it doesn't exceed $7,500.

I need to make sure each step is clearly defined, using the same structure as the examples. I'll start each line with a '#' and follow the order of sections provided in the examples.

# Destination cities #  
# Set cities to be a list includes 2 cities in Michigan  
# Loop through cities for 2 destination cities  
# Initialize Z3 solver s  
# Set 'city' variable to be indexes of 2 destination cities  

# Departure dates #  
# Set 'departure_dates' variables for 2 transportations between cities  
# Assert first transportation happens at first day (day 0), last transportation happens at last day (day 4)  

# Transportation methods #  
# Set transportation method (flight, self-driving, taxi) variable for 2 transportations between cities  
# Assert only one of flight, self-driving, or taxi is used for 2 transportations between cities  
# Assert all 2 transportations between cities are not flight  

# Flight information #  
# Run FlightSearch to get flight info for Omaha as origin, list of cities, city_0 and city_1, and dates ["2022-03-19", "2022-03-20", "2022-03-21", "2022-03-22", "2022-03-23"]  
# Get specific flight price info with Omaha as origin and final destination, specific city, and departure date for 2 transportations  
# Set 'flight_index' variable for 2 transportations  
# Assert 2 'flight_index' variables are within valid range if taking flight, assert flight index to be -1 if not taking flight  

# Driving information #  
# Run DistanceSearch to get driving info for Omaha as origin and city_0, then city_0 as origin and city_1  
# Get specific driving distance info with Omaha as origin and final destination, specific city, and departure date for 2 transportations  
# Assert driving info is not empty if driving  
# Calculate self-driving and taxi price for 3 people and 2 transportations based on driving distance  
# Get driving arrival time with Omaha as origin and final destination, specific city, and departure date for 2 transportations  

# Restaurant information #  
# Get arrivals and city list for each day based on 2 transportations, 5 total travel day, and departure dates variables  
# Run RestaurantSearch to get restaurant price info and cuisine info for city_0 and city_1  
# Set 'restaurant_in_which_city' variables for 15 (3 meals per day, 5 days) meals  
# For each 'restaurant_in_which_city' variable, assert it to be either current city or next city based on transportation arrivals time  
# Set 'restaurant_index' variables for 15 (3 meals per day, 5 days) meals  
# For each 'restaurant_index', get specific price info based on 'restaurant_in_which_city' variable, assert index are within valid range, assert restaurants in same city are not repeated, and calculate restaurant price for 3 people  

# Attraction information #  
# Run AttractionSearch to get attraction info for city_0 and city_1  
# Set 'attraction_in_which_city' variables for 5 (1 per day) attractions  
# For each 'attraction_in_which_city' variable, assert it to be either current city or next city based on transportation arrivals time  
# Set 'attraction_index' variables for 5 (1 per day) attractions  
# For each 'attraction_index', get specific length info based on attraction in which city variable, assert index are within valid range, and attrations in same city are not repeated  

# Accommodation information #  
# Run AccommodationSearch to get accommodation info and accommodation constraints for city_0 and city_1  
# Set 'accommodation_index' variables for 2 (1 per city) accommodations  
# For each 'accommodation_index', get specific price info based on accommodation in which city variable, assert 'accommodation_index' variable are within valid range, calculate number of room need for 3 people and accommodation price  
# For each city, get accommodation minimum night info and assert it to be less than the days stay in this city  
# For each 'accommodation_index', get specific room type info, assert 'Private room' exist for all accommodations  

# Budget #  
# Set budget limit variable to be 7500  
# Add 2 transportation price to spent, according to whether transportation method is flight, self-driving, or taxi  
# Add restaurant price to spent  
# Add accommodation price to spent  
# Assert current spent is within budget
