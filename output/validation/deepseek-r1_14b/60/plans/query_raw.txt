Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the user's query is about a 7-day trip starting in Billings and visiting 3 cities in Texas between March 25th and 31st, 2022. The budget is $8,500 for one person.

Looking at the examples, I see that "org" is the departure city, so that's Billings. "dest" is the destination state or city; here it's Texas. Since they're visiting 3 cities in Texas, "visiting_city_number" should be 3. The trip spans from March 25th to March 31st, which is 7 days, so "days":7.

The dates need to be listed as an array. Let me list them out: 2022-03-25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. 

"people_number" is 1 since it's for one person. The budget is $8,500.

Now, checking the local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any of these, so all should be null.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field is correctly placed and that only necessary fields are included without nulls unless specified.

```json
{
    "org": "Billings", 
    "dest": "Texas", 
    "days": 7, 
    "visiting_city_number": 3, 
    "date": ["2022-03-25", "2022-03-26", "2022-03-27", "2022-03-28", "2022-03-29", "2022-03-30", "2022-03-31"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 8500
}
```
