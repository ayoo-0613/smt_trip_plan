Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully:

"Can you help me create a 7-day travel itinerary for 2 people, starting from Miami, visiting 3 different cities in California from March 8th to March 14th, 2022? Our budget for the trip is $7,200. We enjoy Mexican and American cuisine."

I need to identify each required field:

- **org**: The departure city. From the text, it's Miami.
- **dest**: The destination state or region. Here, it's California.
- **days**: Total travel days. The trip spans from March 8th to March 14th, which is 7 days.
- **visiting_city_number**: Since days exceed 3, I need the number of cities in the destination state. The text mentions visiting 3 different cities.
- **date**: Need to list each day as an array. From March 8th to March 14th, inclusive, that's seven dates.
- **people_number**: The user specifies it's for 2 people.
- **local_constraint**: This has four subfields: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation.

Looking at the text again, I don't see any mention of house rules (parties, smoking, etc.), room type preferences, or transportation constraints. However, they do mention enjoying Mexican and American cuisines. So for "cuisine," it should be ["Mexican", "American"]. The other local constraints aren't mentioned, so they'll remain null.

Lastly, the budget is $7,200, which I need to include as a number without the dollar sign.

I should structure all this into JSON format, ensuring that each field is correctly placed and follows the examples provided. Also, make sure that "visiting_city_number" is set to 3 since they're visiting three cities in California over seven days.
