Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the constraints from this natural language query into code step by step. Let me start by reading the query carefully.

The user is asking for a 3-day travel plan for a solo traveler going from Detroit to San Diego between March 5th and March 7th, 2022, with a budget of $3,000. 

First, I'll break down the key components:

1. **Travel Details**: Solo traveler, departing from Detroit, destination is San Diego. The trip duration is 3 days, so departure dates are March 5th to March 7th.

2. **Budget**: Total budget is $3,000. This will cover transportation, accommodation, food, and any activities.

Now, looking at the examples provided, I see that each step involves setting up variables for cities, departure dates, transportation methods, restaurant info, attractions, accommodations, and then calculating the budget.

Starting with the destination cities: Since the journey is from Detroit to San Diego, the only destination city is San Diego. So, I'll set the cities list to include just San Diego.

Next, departure dates: There are two transportations (from Detroit to San Diego), so I need to set 'departure_dates' for these two trips. The first should be on March 5th and the second on March 7th.

Transportation methods: Since it's a solo traveler and they might prefer not flying, but maybe driving or taking a train. So, I'll allow options like self-driving, taxi, or bus. But in this case, since it's a long distance, perhaps only driving is feasible.

Then, for each transportation method, I need to get the info—like distances and costs—and calculate prices based on that. Since there are two transportations, I'll loop through them.

For restaurants, being a solo traveler, they might look for places that offer single-person dining options. So, I'll set up variables for meals over three days, ensuring each restaurant is suitable for one person.

Accommodation: As a solo traveler, private rooms or single occupancy would be ideal. So, when searching for accommodations, I'll filter for those that offer single rooms and check the minimum nights required.

Attractions: The user didn't specify any particular attractions, so maybe just general ones in San Diego. But since it's a solo trip, perhaps they'd prefer places they can enjoy alone, like parks or museums.

Budget calculation will involve summing up transportation, food, and accommodation costs. I'll set the budget limit to $3,000 and ensure that the total doesn't exceed this.

I think I've covered all the necessary steps based on the examples. Now, I'll structure each step accordingly.
