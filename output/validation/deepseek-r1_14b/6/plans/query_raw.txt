Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me start by reading the query carefully.

The user provided a text: "Please assist in crafting a travel plan for a solo traveller, journeying from Detroit to San Diego for 3 days, from March 5th to March 7th, 2022. The travel plan should accommodate a total budget of $3,000."

First, I'll identify the key components they mentioned. They want me to extract "org" (departure city), "dest" (destination), "days", and other details.

Looking at the text:
- Departure city is Detroit.
- Destination is San Diego.
- The trip duration is 3 days, from March 5th to March 7th, 2022. So I'll need to format the dates as an array in YYYY-MM-DD format: ["2022-03-05", "2022-03-06", "2022-03-07"].
- The traveler is a solo, so people_number is 1.

Next, I need to check for local constraints. The user mentioned nothing about house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions. So all these should be null in the JSON.

Budget is $3,000, which I'll include as an integer without the dollar sign.

I also notice that since days are exactly 3, "visiting_city_number" defaults to 1, as per their examples where visiting cities only apply when days exceed 3. So in this case, it's 1.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each field filled accordingly, ensuring nulls for unspecified constraints and correct formatting of dates and numbers.

```json
{
    "org": "Detroit", 
    "dest": "San Diego", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-05", "2022-03-06", "2022-03-07"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 3000
}
```
