Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions based on the examples provided. Let me start by breaking down the query.

The user is asking for a 7-day travel itinerary for two people departing from Santa Ana and visiting three cities in Colorado from March 1st to March 7th, 2022. Their budget is $7,700. They require private room accommodations and won't be self-driving. For dining, they prefer Italian, French, Chinese, and American cuisines.

Looking at the examples, each step starts with a '#' and follows a specific structure for different aspects like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, etc. I'll need to cover all these areas in order.

First, I'll handle the destination cities. Since they're visiting three cities in Colorado, I'll list them and set up variables accordingly. Next, departure dates will involve setting variables for each day of the trip. Transportation methods are important because they won't be self-driving, so I'll exclude that option. 

Flight information is next; I'll need to search for flights from Santa Ana to each city in Colorado on the specified dates. Then, driving information isn't needed since they're not self-driving, but I should still note that taxis or other methods might be considered.

For restaurants, I have to ensure that each meal option includes their preferred cuisines. I'll set up variables for each restaurant and check against the required types. Accommodation details will focus on private rooms, so I'll search for those in each city and calculate costs based on two people.

Budgeting is crucial here. I'll sum up all expenses—transportation, dining, and accommodation—and ensure they don't exceed $7,700. Each step should be methodical, following the examples' structure to cover all necessary aspects without missing any details.
