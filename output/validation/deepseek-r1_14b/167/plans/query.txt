Could you devise a 7-day travel itinerary for two people, departing from Santa Ana and visiting three cities in Colorado from March 1st to March 7th, 2022? Our budget is set at $7,700. We require accommodations in the form of private rooms, and we will not be self-driving. For dining, we hold a preference for Italian, French, Chinese, and American cuisines.
