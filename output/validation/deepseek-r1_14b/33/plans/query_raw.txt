Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the departure city is Denver, so "org" will be "Denver". The destination is Washington, but since they're visiting two cities there, "dest" should just be "Washington".

Next, the trip duration is 5 days, so "days": 5. Since days exceed 3, I need to check if "visiting_city_number" is mentioned. The text says visiting 2 cities in Washington, so that's 2.

The dates are from March 23rd to March 27th, 2022. I'll format these as an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format: ["2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", ..., "2022-03-27"].

The user specified it's for one person, so "people_number": 1. Now, looking at local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any of these, so all should be null.

Lastly, the budget is $4,200, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

I think that's all the information needed. Let me put it together in JSON format.

```json
{
    "org": "Denver", 
    "dest": "Washington", 
    "days": 5, 
    "visiting_city_number": 2, 
    "date": ["2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25", "2022-03-26", "2022-03-27"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 4200
}
```
