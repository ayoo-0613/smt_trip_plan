I'm looking for a 7-day travel itinerary for 2 people, starting from Reno and heading to Texas, specifically visiting 3 different cities. The travel dates are from March 7th to March 13th, 2022, with a set budget of $4,300. We require accommodations that adhere to house rules regarding visitors and should ideally be entire rooms. For food, we would love to try a variety of cuisines, including Chinese, French, American, and Mediterranean.
