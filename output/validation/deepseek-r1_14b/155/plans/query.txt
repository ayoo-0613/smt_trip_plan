Can you plan a 5-day travel itinerary from Boston to New York for two people, visiting 2 different cities between March 7th and March 11th, 2022? Our budget is now set at $2,700 for this trip. Please note that we require accommodations that allow parties, and we would like rooms that are not shared. Lastly, for our travel, we'd prefer not to fly.
