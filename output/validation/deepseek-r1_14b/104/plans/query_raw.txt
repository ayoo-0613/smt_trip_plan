Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully:

"Can you help me create a one-week travel itinerary for two people, starting in Tulsa and visiting three different cities in Missouri from March 14th till March 20th, 2022? Our budget is $8,800 and we would like to have private rooms for our accommodations."

I need to identify each required field:

1. **org**: The departure city. From the text, it's Tulsa.
2. **dest**: The destination state or region. Here, it's Missouri.
3. **days**: Total travel days. They mentioned a one-week trip, so that's 7 days.
4. **visiting_city_number**: Since they're visiting three cities in Missouri and days exceed 3, this should be 3.
5. **date**: Need to list each day from March 14th to March 20th, 2022. That would be seven dates.
6. **people_number**: They mentioned two people, so that's 2.
7. **local_constraint**: This has four subfields:
   - **house rule**: The text doesn't mention any specific rules like parties or smoking, so null.
   - **cuisine**: No preferences were stated, so null.
   - **room type**: They specified private rooms, which is one of the options.
   - **transportation**: There's no info on transportation constraints, so null.

8. **budget**: The budget given is $8,800.

I should make sure that all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated to be null. Also, "visiting_city_number" is only included when days exceed 3, which they do here (7 days).

Now, I'll structure this into JSON format as per the examples provided.

```json
{
    "org": "Tulsa", 
    "dest": "Missouri", 
    "days": 7, 
    "visiting_city_number": 3, 
    "date": ["2022-03-14", "2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17", "2022-03-18", "2022-03-19", "2022-03-20"], 
    "people_number": 2, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": "private room", 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 8800
}
