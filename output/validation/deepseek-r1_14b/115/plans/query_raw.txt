Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON based on specific rules they provided.

First, I'll read the example they gave to understand the format. In Example 1, they extracted departure city (org), destination (dest), days, visiting cities number, dates, people number, local constraints, and budget. So, I need to follow that structure.

Looking at the text: "I require a 7-day travel plan for two people, beginning in Minneapolis and continuing to three different cities in Texas from March 22 to March 28, 2022. Our budget is $11,900. Accommodations must be suitable for children under 10."

Breaking it down:

- org: Minneapolis
- dest: Texas (since they're traveling to three cities there)
- days: 7
- visiting_city_number: 3 (because they're visiting three cities in Texas)
- date: March 22 to March 28, so I'll list each day as an array.
- people_number: 2
- local_constraint: They mentioned children under 10, which falls under "house rule." So, house rule is "children under 10." The other constraints like cuisine, room type, and transportation aren't mentioned, so they should be null.

Budget is $11,900. 

I need to make sure the date format is YYYY-MM-DD for each day. Also, since days exceed 3, visiting_city_number is specified as 3.

Local constraints only have house rule filled in; others are null because there's no info about cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions.

So putting it all together into JSON with proper formatting.

    "people_number": 2, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": "children under 10", 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 11900
}
