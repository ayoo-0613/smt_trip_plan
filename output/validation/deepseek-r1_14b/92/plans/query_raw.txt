Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON following specific guidelines. First, I'll read through the examples provided to understand how each part should be handled.

The text mentions a 5-day travel plan for a group of 3 starting in New Orleans and visiting two cities in Florida. The dates are March 12th to March 16th, 2022, with a budget of $4,200. They prefer entire rooms for accommodations.

I'll start by identifying the "org" as New Orleans and "dest" as Florida. Since the trip spans five days, "days" is set to 5. The visiting city number is 2 because they're visiting two cities in Florida. 

Next, I need to parse the dates. March 12th to March 16th gives me five consecutive days, so I'll list each date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

The group consists of three people, so "people_number" is 3. The budget is straightforward at $4,200.

Looking at local constraints: house rule isn't mentioned, so it's null. Cuisine isn't specified either, so that's null too. For room type, they prefer entire rooms, which I'll note under "house type." Transportation isn't discussed, so that remains null.

I need to ensure all fields are filled except where the text doesn't provide information. No other constraints like parties or smoking are mentioned, so those stay as null. 

Putting it all together, I structure each field accordingly, making sure the JSON format matches the examples provided. Double-checking each part to avoid missing any details and ensuring that only necessary fields are included without adding extra nulls where they aren't needed.
