Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me break down the query step by step.

First, the user provided a sample text: "Can you create a 5-day travel plan for me that begins in Billings and includes visits to 2 cities in Minnesota? The journey should take place from March 6th to March 10th, 2022, with a budget of $4,000."

Looking at the examples, I know "org" is the departure city. So, org should be Billings.

Next, dest is the destination. In this case, it's Minnesota since they're visiting two cities there.

Days are straightforward; the text says 5 days, so that goes into "days".

Visiting_city_number refers to how many cities in the destination state. The user mentions visiting 2 cities, so that's 2.

Date needs to be formatted as an array of strings. March 6th to March 10th translates to ["2022-03-06", "2022-03-07", "2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", "2022-03-10"].

People_number isn't mentioned, so it should be null. But wait, the user didn't specify the number of people, but in their examples, they included it even if not mentioned? No, looking back, in example 1, it was for a single person, and in example 2, two people. In this case, since it's not specified, I think "people_number" should be null.

Local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The user didn't mention any of these, so all should be null.

Budget is $4,000, so that goes into the JSON as 4000.

Wait, in example 3, they included people_number even though it wasn't mentioned? No, example 3 had a group of 3. So if not specified, perhaps we leave it as null unless stated otherwise.

So putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly.
