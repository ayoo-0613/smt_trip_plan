Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully:

"Could you create a 5-day travel plan for two people, beginning in Newark and visiting 2 cities in Wisconsin from March 13th to March 17th, 2022? Our budget is set at $2,700 and we prefer to stay in shared rooms."

I need to identify each required field:

1. **org**: The departure city. From the text, it's Newark.
2. **dest**: The destination state or region. Here, it's Wisconsin.
3. **days**: Total travel days. The trip spans from March 13th to March 17th, which is 5 days.
4. **visiting_city_number**: Since days exceed 3 and they're visiting Wisconsin, I need to check if the text mentions how many cities. It says "2 cities in Wisconsin," so this should be 2.
5. **date**: Need to list each day from March 13th to March 17th in YYYY-MM-DD format.
6. **people_number**: The text specifies two people, so that's 2.
7. **local_constraint**: This has four subfields:
   - **house rule**: Check if any constraints are mentioned. The user prefers shared rooms but doesn't mention house rules like parties or smoking. So, null here.
   - **cuisine**: No mention of specific cuisines, so null.
   - **room type**: They prefer shared rooms, which is one of the options provided.
   - **transportation**: The text doesn't specify any transportation constraints, so null.

8. **budget**: Given as $2,700.

I should ensure that all fields are filled except where specified to be null if not mentioned. Also, "visiting_city_number" is only included when days exceed 3, which it does here (5 days).

Now, putting this together into the JSON structure as per examples.

```json

    "dest": "Wisconsin", 
    "days": 5, 
    "visiting_city_number": 2, 
    "date": ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17"], 
    "people_number": 2, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": "shared room", 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 2700
}
