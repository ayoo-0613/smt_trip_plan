Can you assist in creating a 3-day travel itinerary for two people, beginning in Elmira and ending in Detroit from March 25th to March 27th, 2022? We have a budget of $2,200. For our stay, we would like to have entire rooms and they need to be pet-friendly. Regarding food, we would love to experience French, Mexican, American, and Mediterranean cuisines during our trip.
