Can you help formulate a 3-day travel plan for 2 people, starting from Los Angeles and heading to Detroit, from March 18th to March 20th, 2022? Our total budget for the trip is $2,000. For accommodations, we need places that allow visitors. Also, we're looking for opportunities to savor diverse cuisines, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. We prefer not to self-drive during the journey.
