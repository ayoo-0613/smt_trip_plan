Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read through the example they gave to understand how it's structured.

In Example 1, the JSON includes "org" as departure city, "dest" as destination, "days", "visiting_city_number", dates, people number, local constraints, and budget. The local constraints have four possible options: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. Each can be null if not mentioned.

Looking at the user's text, it starts with a 3-day trip from Los Angeles to Detroit, so org is LA and dest is Detroit. Days are 3, so visiting_city_number should be 1 since days don't exceed 3. Dates are March 18th to 20th, which I'll format as ["2022-03-18", "2022-03-19", "2022-03-20"]. People number is 2.

Next, local constraints: they mention allowing visitors, so house rule should be "visitors". For cuisine, they want Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Room type isn't specified, but they prefer not to self-drive, so transportation is "no self-driving".

Budget is $2000. I'll make sure all fields are filled, setting null where info isn't provided. Let me structure this into JSON accordingly.

```json
{
    "org": "Los Angeles", 
    "dest": "Detroit", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-18", "2022-03-19", "2022-03-20"], 
    "people_number": 2, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": "visitors", 
        "cuisine": ["Chinese", "Indian", "Mexican", "Italian"], 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": "no self-driving"
    }, 
    "budget": 2000
}
