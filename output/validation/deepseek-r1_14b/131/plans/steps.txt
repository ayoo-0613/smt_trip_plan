Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a 3-day travel plan based on this query. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user wants a trip from Los Angeles to Detroit over three days starting March 18th and ending March 20th, 2022. They're traveling with one other person, so two people total. The budget is $2,000, which isn't too high, so I need to keep costs in check.

They mentioned they don't want to self-drive, so transportation will likely be flights or taxis. But since it's a short trip, maybe there are direct flights? Or perhaps they'll take a flight from LA to Detroit with one stop somewhere else.

Accommodation needs to allow visitors, which probably means hotels that permit guests or B&Bs. They also want to experience diverse cuisines: Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. So I need to make sure each meal option includes these types of restaurants in the cities they visit.

Looking at the examples provided, the steps involve setting up cities, departure dates, transportation methods, restaurant info, attractions, accommodations, and budget checks. 

I think the first step is to set the destination city as Detroit since it's the endpoint. Then, handle the departure dates for two transportations (maybe arrival and departure flights). Transportation method will be flight or taxi, but since they prefer not to self-drive, probably flights.

For restaurants, I need to ensure that each day includes at least one restaurant from each cuisine type. Maybe spread them out over breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day.

Accommodation should be booked in Detroit for the two nights, ensuring it's visitor-friendly. Budgeting will involve adding up flight costs, accommodation, meals, and any attractions they might visit.

I need to make sure all these steps are followed as per the examples, starting each line with a '#'. I'll structure it similarly, making sure not to miss any details like cuisine types or transportation constraints.
