Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text says: "Can you help me craft a 3-day travel plan for two people, starting from South Bend and ending in Atlanta, from March 6th to March 8th, 2022? Our budget is $1,500. We require accommodations that allow parties and we're interested in tasting local Mediterranean, American, Chinese, and Indian cuisines. Additionally, we are not planning on driving ourselves."

Starting with the basics: "org" is South Bend, and "dest" is Atlanta. The trip spans 3 days, so "days" is 3. Since it's a 3-day trip, visiting_city_number should be 1 because they're only ending in one destination state.

Next, the dates are March 6th to March 8th, 2022. I'll format these as ["2022-03-06", "2022-03-07", "2022-03-08"]. The number of people is two, so "people_number" is 2.

Looking at local constraints: They mention parties are allowed, so "house rule" should be "parties". For cuisine, they're interested in Mediterranean, American, Chinese, and Indian. I'll list all four under "cuisine".

Transportation-wise, they're not planning to self-drive, so "transportation" is "no self-driving". There's no mention of room type, so that remains null.

Budget is $1,500, which I'll include as 1500 in the JSON. 

I need to ensure all fields are filled except where specified to be null. So, house rule and cuisine have values, while others don't. Double-checking everything fits the examples provided.
