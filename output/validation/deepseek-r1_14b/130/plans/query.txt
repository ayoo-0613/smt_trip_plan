Can you help me craft a 3-day travel plan for two people, starting from South Bend and ending in Atlanta, from March 6th to March 8th, 2022? Our budget is $1,500. We require accommodations that allow parties and we're interested in tasting local Mediterranean, American, Chinese, and Indian cuisines. Additionally, we are not planning on driving ourselves.
