Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the constraints from this natural language query into code based on the examples provided. Let me start by breaking down the query step by step.

First, the user is a group of 6 people planning a week-long vacation from March 21st to March 27th, 2022. They're starting in Billings and want to visit 3 cities in Arizona. Their budget is $11,700, and they need accommodations that allow visitors.

Looking at the examples, I see that each constraint is handled with specific steps, often involving setting variables, asserting conditions, and calculating costs. So I'll follow a similar structure.

Starting with destination cities: They want to visit 3 cities in Arizona. In the examples, this involved running a search for these cities and assigning indexes. So I'll need to set up a list of these cities and loop through them to assign each an index variable.

Next, departure dates: The trip spans from March 21st to March 27th, which is 7 days. They have 3 transportations (since they're visiting 3 cities), so I'll need to set 'departure_dates' variables for these and ensure the first transportation happens on day 0 and the last on day 6.

Transportation methods: The group doesn't mention flights, but in previous examples, sometimes flight was excluded. However, since they're traveling across states, maybe driving is more likely. But I should consider all options unless specified otherwise. So I'll set variables for each transportation method (flight, self-driving, taxi) and ensure only one is used per transportation.

Flight information: Since the query doesn't specify avoiding flights, I need to include it but perhaps assert that they're not taking flights if that's implied. Wait, no, in example 3, they didn't take flights, so maybe here too? Or should I leave it open? Hmm, better to follow the examples and see how they handled similar situations.

Wait, looking back at example 3, when they didn't want flights, they asserted all transportations were not flight. So if this group is okay with any method, including flights, then maybe no such assertion is needed unless specified. But in their query, they just say "intent to visit," so I think it's safer to allow any transportation method.

Moving on, restaurant information: They want accommodations that allow visitors, but more importantly, there's no mention of specific cuisines, unlike previous examples where they mentioned American and Chinese. So perhaps the cuisine part isn't needed here. But wait, in example 3, they did specify cuisines, so maybe I should check if any are required here. The query doesn't say anything about food, so maybe that section can be omitted or generalized.

Accommodation information: They need places that allow visitors, which probably means no restrictions like "no visitors allowed." So in the accommodation constraints, I'll ensure that such house rules don't exist for all accommodations.

Budgeting: The total budget is $11,700. I'll set a variable for this and then sum up transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs to assert they're within the limit.

Putting it all together, each step will involve setting variables, asserting conditions based on the query, and calculating costs accordingly. I need to make sure each part is addressed without missing any constraints from the user's request.
