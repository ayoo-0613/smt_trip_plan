Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read through the example they gave to understand how it's structured.

In Example 1, the JSON includes "org" as departure city, "dest" as destination, "days", "visiting_city_number", dates, people number, local constraints, and budget. The local constraints have four possible options, each with specific allowed values or null if not mentioned.

Looking at the new text: It's a group of 6 starting from Billings to Arizona, visiting 3 cities over a week (7 days) from March 21 to 27, 2022. Budget is $11,700, and accommodations should allow visitors.

I need to extract each piece:

- org: Billings
- dest: Arizona
- days: 7
- visiting_city_number: 3 (since they're visiting 3 cities in Arizona)
- dates: March 21 to 27, so I'll list each date as an array.
- people_number: 6
- local_constraint: Check the text for any mentions. It says "allow visitors," which falls under house rule. So house rule is "visitors." The other constraints (cuisine, room type, transportation) aren't mentioned, so they're null.

Budget is straightforward at $11,700.

I should make sure all fields are filled except where it's specified to be null. Also, the date format needs to be YYYY-MM-DD for each day in an array.

Double-checking everything: org and dest are correct, days and visiting cities match the text, dates are correctly formatted, people number is 6, local constraints only have "visitors" under house rule, and budget is set. Looks good.
