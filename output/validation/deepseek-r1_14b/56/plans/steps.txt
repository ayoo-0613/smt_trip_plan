Okay, so I need to plan a 7-day solo trip starting in Los Angeles and visiting three different cities in Florida between March 22nd and March 28th, 2022, with a budget of $4,700. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out the destination cities in Florida. Since I'm starting in Los Angeles, I'll need to find three distinct cities in Florida that I can visit within seven days. Maybe places like Miami, Orlando, and Tampa? I'll use a CitySearch tool to get all possible cities in Florida for those dates and then make sure they're different from each other.

Next, I need to set up the departure dates. Since it's a 7-day trip with three cities, there will be four transportations: from LA to city 1, city 1 to city 2, city 2 to city 3, and finally city 3 back to LA. Each transportation should have a specific date assigned, starting on March 22nd and ending on March 28th.

Transportation methods are another consideration. I can choose between flight, self-driving, or taxi. Since it's a solo trip and I don't want the hassle of driving long distances, maybe flights would be more convenient. But I should check if flying is within budget.

For each transportation leg, I'll need to gather information on flight availability, prices, and times. If I decide against flights, self-driving might be cheaper but time-consuming, while a taxi could be expensive for long distances. I'll set up variables for each transportation method and ensure that only one is used per leg.

Looking into flight information, I'll use FlightSearch to get details from LA to each Florida city on the specified dates. Then, I'll calculate the cost based on the flight index, making sure it's within my budget. If flights aren't feasible, I'll look into driving or taking a taxi, calculating costs based on distance and time.

For restaurants, since I'm solo traveling, I need to plan meals for each day. There are three meals per day over seven days, so 21 meals in total. I should find restaurants in the cities I visit that offer different cuisines to make the trip more interesting. Using RestaurantSearch, I'll get price info and cuisine options, then set variables for each meal location based on current or next city after transportation.

Attractions are also important. Each day should have one main attraction, so seven attractions in total. I'll use AttractionSearch to find places in each city that match the days' activities. Then, assign each attraction to a specific day and ensure they're either in the current or next city based on transportation schedules.

Accommodation is another key aspect. Since it's a solo trip, I need private rooms for comfort. Using AccommodationSearch, I'll get info on hotels in each Florida city, ensuring they have private rooms and meet my budget constraints. I'll set variables for each accommodation, check minimum nights required, and calculate the total cost.

Finally, I'll tally up all expenses: transportation, restaurants, attractions, and accommodations. Adding them together should not exceed $4,700. If any part is over budget, I'll need to adjust by choosing cheaper options or reducing some activities.

Throughout this process, I might realize that flying from LA to Florida could be expensive, so maybe self-driving would save money but take more time. Alternatively, taking a flight within Florida between cities might be cheaper than renting a car each time. I also need to ensure that the attractions and restaurants are spread out reasonably without overlapping too much in one city.

I should also check if the minimum nights required for accommodations match my stay duration in each city. For example, if I'm staying in Miami for two nights, the hotel must allow at least two-night stays. If not, I might have to adjust my itinerary or choose a different hotel.

Overall, it's a matter of balancing budget, time, and preferences while ensuring all logistics like transportation, meals, and accommodations are properly planned and within the $4,700 limit.
