Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. First, I'll read the example they provided to understand exactly what they're looking for.

Looking at Example 1, I see that "org" is the departure city, "dest" is where they're going, "days" is the total travel days, and if days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" specifies how many cities in the destination state. The date field includes each day's date in order.

Then there's the "local_constraint" section with four possible constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. Each of these can have specific options or be null if not mentioned. Other fields like people_number and budget are straightforward.

Now, looking at the user's text: They're planning a 7-day solo trip from Los Angeles to Florida, visiting 3 cities, with dates from March 22nd to 28th, 2022, and a budget of $4,700. 

First, I'll extract "org" as Los Angeles and "dest" as Florida since that's where the cities are located. The trip is 7 days long, so "days":7. Since days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number":3.

Next, the dates need to be converted into an array of strings in YYYY-MM-DD format. March 22nd is 2022-03-22, and it goes up to March 28th, so I'll list all those dates in order.

The user mentioned it's a solo trip, so "people_number":1. The budget is $4,700, which I'll include as is.

Now, checking for local constraints: the text doesn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type requirements, or transportation restrictions. So all these will be null in the JSON.

Putting it all together, I structure each field accordingly, ensuring that all required fields are filled and only necessary constraints are included with their respective values or null if not specified.
