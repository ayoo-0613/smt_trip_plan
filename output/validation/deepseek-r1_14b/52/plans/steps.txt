Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a detailed step-by-step instruction based on the given natural language query. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The query is: "Could you help create a 7-day travel plan for one person departing from Wichita to Colorado that includes visiting 3 cities? The travel dates are from March 7th to March 13th, 2022, and the travel budget is $5,900."

First, I'll break down the key components of this query. The user wants a 7-day itinerary for one person traveling from Wichita to Colorado, visiting three cities. The departure dates are March 7th to March 13th, 2022, and the budget is $5,900.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each step starts with a '#' and follows a specific structure. Each section addresses different aspects like destination cities, transportation methods, flight information, driving details, restaurant planning, attraction visits, accommodation arrangements, and budget management.

So, for this query, I'll need to outline steps similar to the examples but tailored to the specifics of the user's request. Let me go through each part step by step.

1. **Destination Cities**: The user wants to visit three cities in Colorado. So, I'll list these cities and ensure they are included in the plan.

2. **Departure Dates**: The travel period is from March 7th to March 13th, which is exactly 7 days. I need to set up variables for departure dates across two transportations (since it's a round trip: Wichita to Colorado and return).

3. **Transportation Methods**: Since the user didn't specify any preferences, I'll assume they might consider driving or flying. So, I'll set up variables for both options but ensure that only one method is chosen.

4. **Flight Information**: If flights are considered, I'll need to retrieve flight data from Wichita to each of the three cities in Colorado and back. Then, calculate the cost based on the number of people (one person) and check if it's within budget.

5. **Driving Information**: If driving is chosen, I'll get distance information between Wichita and each city, then compute costs for self-driving or taxi services.

6. **Restaurant Planning**: The user didn't specify any cuisine preferences, so I might not need to set specific types. However, ensuring that meals are affordable and within budget is essential.

7. **Attraction Information**: For each of the three cities, I'll gather attraction details and plan one daily activity, making sure they fit into the itinerary based on arrival times.

8. **Accommodation Arrangements**: Since it's a 7-day trip visiting three cities, I'll need to book hotels in each city for the respective nights, ensuring minimum stay requirements are met and room types are suitable (probably private rooms since it's one person).

9. **Budget Management**: Sum up all transportation, accommodation, food, and attraction costs and ensure they don't exceed $5,900.

Now, I'll structure these thoughts into a step-by-step format following the examples provided.
