Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read through the example they gave to understand how it's structured.

In Example 1, the JSON includes "org" as departure city, "dest" as destination, "days" for total travel days, and so on. The local constraints have four possible options, each with predefined choices. If not mentioned, set them to null, but other fields must have values.

Now, looking at the user's text: They want a 7-day plan from Wichita to Colorado, visiting 3 cities. Dates are March 7th to 13th, and budget is $5900. 

I'll start by extracting each piece of information:

- "org" should be Wichita.
- "dest" is Colorado.
- "days" is 7.
- Since days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" is 3.
- Dates need to be converted into an array from March 7th to 13th. I'll format them as YYYY-MM-DD.
- The person number is 1.
- Checking local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any of these, so all should be null.

I need to make sure each field is correctly placed and that the date array is properly formatted. Also, since there's no mention of budget in the user's example, I'll include it as 5900.

Wait, in the provided JSON response, the budget isn't included. Hmm, looking back at the examples, sometimes budget is present, but in this case, the user did specify a budget of $5,900. So I should include that.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Wichita as org, Colorado as dest, 7 days, visiting 3 cities, dates from March 7th to 13th, one person, and local constraints null except where specified. Budget is included as 5900.

I think that's everything. Let me structure it accordingly.

    "dest": "Colorado", 
    "days": 7, 
    "visiting_city_number": 3, 
    "date": ["2022-03-07", "2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", "2022-03-10", "2022-03-11", "2022-03-12", "2022-03-13"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 5900
}
