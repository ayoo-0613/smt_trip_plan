Could you help me organize a 5-day trip for 2 people starting from Islip to Pennsylvania, covering 2 cities between March 19th and March 23rd, 2022? Our budget is set at $2,700. We require accommodations that allow children under 10 and prefer to rent entire rooms. For our transportation, we prefer not to take any flights.
