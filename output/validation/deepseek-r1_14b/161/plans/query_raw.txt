Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The trip is for two people from Pittsburgh to New York, lasting a week (7 days) from March 13th to March 19th, 2022. They plan to visit three cities in New York. The budget is $5,300. 

Looking at the constraints:lodgings must allow visitors, so "house rule" should be "visitors". For cuisine, they want French, Italian, Chinese, and American, which I'll list as an array. They're not taking any flights, so "transportation" is "no flight".

I need to make sure all fields are filled except where it's specified to use null. So, org is Pittsburgh, dest is New York, days is 7, visiting_city_number is 3 since they visit three cities in the destination state.

Date needs to be an array of strings in YYYY-MM-DD format. March 13th is 2022-03-13 and so on until March 19th. People number is 2. Budget is 5300.

Local constraints: house rule is "visitors", cuisine includes the four mentioned, room type isn't specified, so null. Transportation is "no flight" as they won't take any flights.

I think that's all. Now I'll structure this into JSON.
