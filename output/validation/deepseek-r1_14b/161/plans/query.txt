We're planning a week-long trip for two from Pittsburgh to New York with a budget of $5,300. We're set to travel from March 13th to March 19th, 2022, and plan to visit three different cities in New York. Please keep in mind that our lodgings must allow visitors. As for meals, we'd love to sample French, Italian, Chinese, and American cuisines. Also, note that we're planning to travel without taking any flights.
