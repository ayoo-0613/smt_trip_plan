Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully. The user is asking for a 3-day travel plan for four people traveling from Dallas to Huntsville between March 13th and 15th, 2022, with a budget of $2700. They specifically mention needing entire rooms.

Looking at the JSON structure examples, I see that "org" is the departure city, which here is Dallas. The destination is Huntsville, so "dest" will be Huntsville. The trip spans three days, so "days" should be 3. Since it's a direct trip without visiting other cities in the destination state, "visiting_city_number" is 1.

The dates need to be formatted as an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. March 13th becomes "2022-03-13", and so on until March 15th. The number of people is clearly stated as 4, so "people_number" is 4.

Next, the local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. In the text, they mention requiring entire rooms, which falls under "room type". So I'll set that to "entire room". There's no mention of parties, smoking, children, or pets, so "house rule" is null. Similarly, there's no specific cuisine mentioned, so "cuisine" remains null. For transportation, they don't mention any restrictions like not self-driving or needing flights, so that's also null.

The budget is $2700, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign. 

I should make sure all fields are filled except where specified to be null. No other constraints are present in the text, so everything else stays as null. 

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly placed and formatted.

```json
{
    "org": "Dallas", 
    "dest": "Huntsville", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15"], 
    "people_number": 4, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": "entire room", 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 2700
}
```
