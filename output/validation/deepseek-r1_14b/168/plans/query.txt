I need assistance in crafting a travel plan starting in Fort Lauderdale and covering 3 cities in Georgia. The trip, designed for 2 people, will span from March 24th to March 30th, 2022. Our budget is $8,000. Regarding accommodations, we require rooms that are not shared and should accommodate children under 10. As for dining options, we have diverse tastes, including Indian, American, Chinese, and Mediterranean cuisines.
