Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a group of 5 departing from Charlotte to Hilton Head over 3 days, from March 26th to 28th, 2022. The budget is $7,000, and they prefer Italian and French cuisines.

Starting with "org" and "dest": org is Charlotte, dest is Hilton Head. Days are 3, so visiting_city_number should be 1 since it's a single destination state.

Next, the date needs to be formatted as an array of strings in YYYY-MM-DD format. So that would be ["2022-03-26", "2022-03-27", "2022-03-28"]. People number is 5.

Looking at local constraints: house rule isn't mentioned, so null. Cuisine preferences are Italian and French, so those should be included as an array. Room type and transportation aren't specified either, so they remain null.

Budget is straightforward at $7,000. I need to make sure all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated that null is acceptable. 

I think that covers everything. Let me structure this into JSON accordingly.

```json
{
    "org": "Charlotte", 
    "dest": "Hilton Head", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-26", "2022-03-27", "2022-03-28"], 
    "people_number": 5, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": ["Italian", "French"], 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 7000
}
```
