Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text says: "Could you propose a one-week travel itinerary for 4 people, leaving from Seattle and heading to Florida from March 17th to March 23rd, 2022? We plan to visit 3 different cities in Florida. Our budget is set at $14,700. We require accommodations that allow parties, and we prefer to rent entire rooms. We also would prefer to avoid driving ourselves during this trip."

Starting with the basics: "org" is Seattle, "dest" is Florida. The duration is one week, which is 7 days. The dates are from March 17th to March 23rd, so I'll need to format those into an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

Next, the number of people is clearly stated as 4. Visiting city number is 3 since they plan to visit three cities in Florida.

Looking at local constraints: They require accommodations that allow parties, so under "house rule," it's "parties." They prefer entire rooms, so "room type" is "entire room." They want to avoid self-driving, which translates to "no self-driving" under transportation. There's no mention of cuisine preferences, so that remains null.

Budget is $14,700, straightforward. 

I need to ensure all fields are filled except where specified as null. The date range should be correctly formatted and include all days from the 17th to the 23rd. Also, checking if "days" exceeds 3—since it's 7, visiting_city_number is included.

Double-checking each part: org, dest, days, visiting city number, dates, people, local constraints, budget. Everything seems covered except cuisine, which stays null.
