Could you assist in formulating a 3-day trip for two individuals, initiating from El Paso and concluding in Phoenix? The travel dates we're considering are March 4th to March 6th, 2022. We have a budget of $1,900. For accommodations, we have one constraint: the establishments must allow visitors. As far as meals go, we have a diverse taste palette, encompassing American, French, Mexican, and Indian cuisines. And to clarify, we are willing to travel, but not via flight.
