Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions based on the examples provided. Let me start by breaking down the query.

The user is asking for a 3-day trip for two people starting in El Paso and ending in Phoenix from March 4th to March 6th, 2022. They have a budget of $1,900. Their accommodation must allow visitors, which I think means they want places that are welcoming or maybe B&Bs. For food, they want restaurants serving American, French, Mexican, and Indian cuisines. They’re willing to travel but not by flight, so ground transportation is the way to go.

Looking at the examples, each step starts with a # and follows a structure addressing different aspects like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, etc. I need to mirror that structure.

First, since they're starting in El Paso and ending in Phoenix, but it's a 3-day trip, I think they might be visiting multiple cities along the way. But the examples show sometimes only one destination if it's a direct trip. Wait, no, in example 3, it was Fort Lauderdale to Milwaukee with one city in between? Or maybe not. Let me check.

Wait, in example 3, the user went from Fort Lauderdale to Milwaukee but didn't specify intermediate cities, so perhaps they just went directly. But since this query is from El Paso to Phoenix, which are both in Texas and Arizona respectively, I think the trip might involve driving through several cities or maybe just a direct drive.

But for the purpose of this step-by-step, I should probably set the destination as Phoenix only because that's where they're concluding. So the cities list would include Phoenix.

Next, departure dates: it's March 4th to March 6th, so three days. They have two transportations: from El Paso to Phoenix and maybe another leg if there are intermediate stops, but since they don't want flights, perhaps it's a direct drive. So two transportations in total.

Transportation methods: no flights, so only self-driving or taxi. But since they're willing to travel, I think self-driving is more likely, but the steps should account for both possibilities.

For each section like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, etc., I need to follow the example structure. So starting with # Destination cities, then # Departure dates, and so on.

I also need to include budget constraints, checking that the total spent doesn't exceed $1,900. For accommodation, they have a specific constraint about allowing visitors, which in the examples was translated into checking house rules. Similarly, for restaurants, I need to ensure all required cuisines are covered.

Let me outline each section:

1. Destination cities: Set as Phoenix only.
2. Departure dates: Two transportations over three days.
3. Transportation methods: Exclude flights, so self-driving or taxi.
4. Driving info: Get distance and calculate costs for two people.
5. Restaurant info: Check for all required cuisines in each city visited.
6. Attraction info: Maybe not needed since the focus is on food and accommodation.
7. Accommodation info: Ensure places allow visitors, i.e., no "No visitors" policy.
8. Budget: Sum up transportation, meals, and accommodation costs.

I need to make sure each step starts with a # and follows the structure from the examples. Also, for each variable like 'restaurant_in_which_city' or 'cuisine_type', I should set them appropriately and check constraints.

Wait, in example 3, they only had one destination city (Milwaukee), but in this case, it's El Paso to Phoenix. So maybe the cities list includes both? Or is El Paso the starting point and Phoenix the end? Hmm, perhaps the cities list should include both, but since they're traveling from El Paso to Phoenix, maybe the intermediate stops are part of the journey.

But for simplicity, in the examples, sometimes only the destination city was listed. So I think it's better to set the cities as a list including El Paso and Phoenix, but perhaps the steps will handle the movement between them.

Wait, no, looking at example 3, they started in Fort Lauderdale and ended in Milwaukee, but the cities variable was set to include only Milwaukee because that's where they were concluding. So maybe in this case, since they're starting in El Paso and ending in Phoenix, the cities list should be [Phoenix], as that's their destination.

But then how do we account for the departure from El Paso? Maybe the first transportation is from El Paso to Phoenix, so only one city variable is needed, which is Phoenix. So I'll set cities = ['Phoenix'].

Then, in the steps, when setting 'city' variables, it will be based on that list.

For departure dates: two transportations over three days, so day 0 and day 2.

Transportation methods: exclude flights, so only self-driving or taxi. So assert all transportations are not flight.

Driving info: get distance from El Paso to Phoenix, calculate costs for two people.

Restaurants: need to cover four cuisines, so set 'cuisine_type' variables accordingly and check each restaurant.

Accommodation: ensure no "No visitors" policy.

Budget: sum up all expenses and assert it's within $1,900.

I think that covers the main points. Now I'll structure each step following the examples.
