Can you assist in creating a comprehensive 5-day travel plan for a group of 7? We'll be starting our journey in Washington, planning to discover 2 cities in New York from March 23rd to March 27th, 2022. A budget of $9,100 is allocated for this trip. Our accommodation preferences are geared toward securing entire rooms. For transportation, we have decided to avoid self-driving. In terms of dining options, we are eager to savor a variety of cuisines, including American, Mexican, Chinese, and Italian.
