Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a 5-day travel plan for a group of 7 people based on the given natural language query. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the user is starting in Washington and wants to visit two cities in New York from March 23rd to March 27th, 2022. The budget is $9,100, and they prefer entire rooms for accommodation. They also don't want to self-drive, so transportation options are limited to flights or taxis. Additionally, they're interested in trying American, Mexican, Chinese, and Italian cuisines.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each query is broken down into several sections: destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, flight information, driving info (if applicable), restaurant info, attraction info, accommodation info, and budget. Since this user doesn't want to self-drive, I can skip the driving information steps.

Starting with destination cities, since they're visiting two cities in New York, I'll list those as city_0 and city_1. Next, departure dates cover March 23rd to March 27th, which is five days, so there are four transportations between Washington and the two cities.

Transportation methods will exclude self-driving, so only flights or taxis are considered. Since they're starting in Washington and moving to two cities, I'll set up variables for each transportation method.

For flight information, I need to run a search from Washington as the origin to each city on the respective dates. Similarly, restaurant information requires checking for the required cuisines in each city. Accommodation needs to ensure entire rooms are available, so I'll look into that and calculate costs accordingly.

Budgeting is crucial here. The total budget is $9,100, so I need to sum up transportation, dining, and accommodation expenses and make sure they don't exceed this amount.

I should also consider the number of people (7) when calculating costs for each service—transportation, meals, and accommodations. Each step needs to be carefully structured to ensure all user preferences are met without exceeding the budget.

Now, I'll outline each section with the necessary steps, making sure to follow the format from the examples provided.
