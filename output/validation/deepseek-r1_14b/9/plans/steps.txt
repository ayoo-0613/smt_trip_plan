Okay, so I need to figure out how to plan this trip based on the user's query. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user wants a trip that starts in Sarasota and ends in Philadelphia over 3 days from March 2nd to March 4th, 2022, with a budget of $2,100. They didn't mention any specific cities they want to visit in between, so I guess it's just the two main cities.

I'll start by identifying the destination cities. Since the trip starts in Sarasota and ends in Philadelphia, those are the only two cities involved. So, I don't need to search for other destinations; it's just these two.

Next, I need to set up the departure dates. The trip spans 3 days, so there will be two transportations: from Sarasota to Philadelphia on March 2nd and maybe returning on March 4th? Or perhaps they stay in Philadelphia overnight. Either way, I'll set the departure dates for these two travel segments.

Then, transportation methods. They didn't specify flying or driving, but since it's a short trip, maybe driving is preferred. So, I'll consider both options—maybe check if flights are cheaper or more convenient. But according to the examples, they often use self-driving or taxi, so I'll set up variables for those.

For flight information, even though the user didn't specify flying, I should still gather data in case it's an option. So, I'll run a FlightSearch from Sarasota to Philadelphia on the given dates and get the prices and arrival times.

Similarly, for driving, I'll use DistanceSearch to find the distance between the two cities and calculate the costs for self-driving or taxi based on that distance.

Moving on to restaurants, since there are only two cities, I'll search for dining options in Sarasota and Philadelphia. The user didn't mention any specific cuisines, so I'll just get general restaurant info.

For attractions, again, focusing on both cities, I'll gather attraction data to plan activities each day.

Accommodation-wise, the user wants private rooms, but since they're traveling between two cities, maybe they'll stay in Sarasota and Philadelphia. So, I'll search for hotels in both cities that offer private rooms.

Budgeting is crucial here. The total budget is $2,100, so I need to sum up all transportation, food, and accommodation costs and ensure it doesn't exceed this amount.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each step as per the examples, making sure to initialize variables, assert conditions, and calculate costs accordingly.
