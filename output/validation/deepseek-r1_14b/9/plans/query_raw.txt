Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the departure city is Sarasota, so "org" should be "Sarasota". The destination is Philadelphia, so "dest" is "Philadelphia".

The trip spans 3 days, from March 2nd to March 4th, 2022. So I'll list those dates in order under "date".

Looking at the example JSONs, when days exceed 3, we need to specify "visiting_city_number", but since it's exactly 3 days here, that field isn't necessary. However, in their examples, even for 3 days, they included "visiting_city_number":1. Wait, no, looking back: Example 1 had 3 days and visiting_city_number as 1 because the destination was a single city. So I think if it's exactly 3 days, we still include it as 1.

The user mentioned a group of people but didn't specify the number. In their examples, when not specified, they left it null? Wait no, in Example 1, it was for a single person, so "people_number":1. But in this case, the text doesn't mention how many people, so I should set it to null as per instructions.

For local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The user didn't mention any of these, so all should be null.

Budget is $2,100, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have org, dest, days, date, people_number as null since not specified, local constraints all null, and budget.

```json
{
    "org": "Sarasota", 
    "dest": "Philadelphia", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-02", "2022-03-03", "2022-03-04"], 
    "people_number": null, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 2100
}
```
