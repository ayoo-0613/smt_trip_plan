Can you create a one-week travel itinerary for two people departing from Myrtle Beach and covering three cities in Michigan between March 4th and March 10th, 2022? Our budget is set at $8,300. We would like to experience both French and American cuisines during our journey. We will require accommodations, though we have no specific house rules in mind.
