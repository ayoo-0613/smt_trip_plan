Please create a 3-day itinerary for a group of 3 departing from Fort Wayne and heading to Charlotte, spanning from March 8th to March 10th, 2022. We have a budget of $1,900. Our group will need to find accommodations that allow pets and provide entire rooms. We would also prefer a journey that doesn't involve any flights.
