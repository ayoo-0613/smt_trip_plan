Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text says: "Please create a 3-day itinerary for a group of 3 departing from Fort Wayne and heading to Charlotte, spanning from March 8th to March 10th, 2022. We have a budget of $1,900. Our group will need accommodations that allow pets and provide entire rooms. We would also prefer a journey that doesn't involve any flights."

Starting with the basics: "org" is Fort Wayne, and "dest" is Charlotte. The trip spans 3 days, so "days" is 3. The dates are March 8th to 10th, which I'll format as ["2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", "2022-03-10"]. There are 3 people in the group, so "people_number" is 3. The budget is $1,900.

Now, looking at local constraints. The user mentions two specific needs: allowing pets and requiring entire rooms. So under "house rule," it's "pets." For "room type," it's "entire room." They also prefer no flights, so "transportation" is "no flight."

I don't see any mention of cuisine preferences, so "cuisine" remains null. All other constraints not mentioned should be null as per instructions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly populated and only necessary constraints are included.
