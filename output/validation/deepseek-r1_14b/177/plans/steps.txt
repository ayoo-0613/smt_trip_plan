Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions for a travel plan problem. Let me start by breaking down the query.

The user is asking for a 7-day itinerary for two people starting in Salt Lake City and visiting three unique cities in Montana from March 16th to 22nd, 2022. The budget is $7,200. They want accommodations that allow parties, and they're interested in trying American, Mediterranean, Indian, and Chinese cuisines. Importantly, they don't plan to drive themselves.

Looking at the examples provided, I see a structure where each step starts with a '#', followed by the action or instruction. The steps are categorized into sections like Destination Cities, Departure Dates, Transportation Methods, etc., each with specific actions.

First, I'll identify the key components of the query:

1. **Destination Cities**: Three unique cities in Montana.
2. **Duration**: 7 days starting March 16th to 22nd.
3. **Budget**: $7,200.
4. **Accommodation Preferences**: Party-permitted places.
5. **Cuisine Requirements**: American, Mediterranean, Indian, Chinese.
6. **Transportation Preference**: No self-driving.

Now, I'll map these components to the example structures.

Starting with Destination Cities: The user wants three cities in Montana. So, I need to set the cities list accordingly and loop through them as per the examples.

Departure Dates: Since it's a 7-day trip, there will be two transportations (from Salt Lake City to first city, then between cities, and finally to the last city). The departure dates should cover March 16th to 22nd.

Transportation Methods: They don't want to drive, so we'll exclude self-driving. We need to set variables for each transportation method used, ensuring only flight or taxi is considered.

Flight Information: Since they prefer not to drive, flights will be the primary mode. I'll run a FlightSearch and handle the indices and prices accordingly.

Driving Information: Even though they don't want to drive, we still need to check if driving info is empty in case it's necessary for any part of the journey.

Restaurant Information: They want various cuisines, so I'll set variables for each required cuisine type and ensure all are covered by checking through restaurants.

Attraction Information: For each day, select attractions based on current or next city, ensuring no repeats within the same city.

Accommodation Information: Find places that allow parties. Check room types and house rules to ensure they meet the criteria.

Budget: Sum up transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs, then assert it's within $7,200.

I'll structure each step following the examples, ensuring all components are addressed methodically.
