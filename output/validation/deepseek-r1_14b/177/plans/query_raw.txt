Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text that needs to be converted into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read through the example they gave to understand exactly what's required.

The user wants me to extract information like departure city (org), destination (dest), number of days, visiting cities, date, people number, local constraints, and budget. The local constraints have four categories: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. Each can be null if not mentioned, but other fields must have values.

Looking at the provided text: It starts with a 7-day itinerary for two people from Salt Lake City to Montana, visiting three cities. Dates are March 16th to 22nd, which is seven days. Budget is $7,200.

For local constraints:
- House rule mentions parties allowed.
- Cuisines include American, Mediterranean, Indian, and Chinese.
- Room type isn't specified, so it's null.
- Transportation prefers not self-driving, so "no self-driving".

I need to structure this into JSON, ensuring all required fields are present. The visiting city number is 3 since they're visiting three cities in Montana.

Double-checking each part: org is Salt Lake City, dest is Montana, days 7, date from March 16th to 22nd, people_number 2. Local constraints have house rule as parties and cuisine with the four options listed. Transportation is set to "no self-driving" as per their preference.

I think that's all covered. Now, I'll format it into JSON accordingly.
