Can you help devise a 7-day travel itinerary for 2 people, beginning in Salt Lake City and includes visiting 3 unique cities in Montana from March 16th to 22nd, 2022? We have a planned budget of $7,200. In terms of accommodations, we would like places where parties are permitted. Throughout our stay, we'd wish to enjoy various cuisines, including American, Mediterranean, Indian, and Chinese. Lastly, we prefer not to drive ourselves throughout this journey.
