Could you help design a travel itinerary for 2 people, starting in Minneapolis and visiting 2 cities in Tennessee, spanning from March 2nd to March 6th, 2022? Our budget is set at $2,000. We will not be considering flight as a mode of transportation and would like to have non-shared rooms for accommodation. Also, we'd prefer smoking-friendly accommodations, as we are smokers.
