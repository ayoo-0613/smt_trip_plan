Could you suggest a 5-day travel itinerary for 2, leaving from Charlotte and visiting 2 cities in Wisconsin from March 18th to March 22nd, 2022? Our travel budget is set at $2,500. We will be traveling with children under 10, so our accommodations must be child-friendly and provide private rooms. Kindly ensure no flights are involved in the transportation planning.
