Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 3-day travel plan for two people from West Palm Beach to White Plains. They're visiting only one city, so "visiting_city_number" should be 1. The dates are March 5th to March 7th, 2022, which I'll format as ["2022-03-05", "2022-03-06", "2022-03-07"]. The budget is $2,600.

Looking at local constraints: they want rooms that are not shared, so under "house type," it's "not shared room." They're not planning to self-drive, so "transportation" should be "no self-driving." For cuisine, they mentioned Mexican, Chinese, Mediterranean, and American. 

I need to make sure all fields are filled except where specified as null. The user didn't mention any house rules beyond the room type, so "house rule" remains null. Cuisine has multiple options, so I'll list them all.

Double-checking everything: org is West Palm Beach, dest is White Plains, days 3, visiting city number 1, dates correct, people number 2, budget right, and local constraints filled appropriately. Looks good!
