Could you help create a 3-day travel plan for two people? We're traveling from West Palm Beach to White Plains, visiting only one city from March 5th to March 7th, 2022. We have a budget of $2,600. For our accommodations, we'd like rooms that are not shared. We are not planning on self-driving and will be reliant on public transportation. Cuisines we are interested in trying include Mexican, Chinese, Mediterranean, and American.
