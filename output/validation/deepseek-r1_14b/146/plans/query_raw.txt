Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text says: "Can you help design a 5-day travel plan for a group of 4, starting from Evansville and visiting 2 cities in Texas? The trip spans from March 12th to March 16th, 2022. Our budget is now $9,500, and for accommodations, we require entire rooms that do not restrict parties. Also, note that we prefer to avoid airline transportation."

Starting with the basics: "org" is Evansville, and "dest" is Texas since they're visiting two cities there. The trip duration is 5 days, so "days":5. Visiting city number is 2.

Next, the dates are from March 12th to March 16th, which I'll format as ["2022-03-12", "2022-03-13", ..., "2022-03-16"]. The group size is 4, so "people_number":4.

Looking at local constraints: They require entire rooms, which falls under "house type". Also, they don't restrict parties, meaning they allow it. For transportation, they prefer avoiding airlines, so that's "no flight".

Cuisine isn't mentioned, so all fields not specified will be null. Budget is $9,500.

I need to make sure each field is correctly mapped and only necessary constraints are included. Let me structure this into JSON accordingly.

    }, 
    "budget": 9500
