Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the constraints from this natural language query into code step by step. Let me start by reading the query carefully.

The user is asking for a 5-day travel plan for 4 people starting in Evansville and visiting 2 cities in Texas. The trip dates are March 12th to March 16th, 2022, with a budget of $9,500. They require accommodations that allow parties and must have entire rooms. Also, they prefer avoiding airline transportation.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each step involves breaking down different aspects like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, flight info, driving info, restaurant info, attraction info, accommodation info, and budgeting.

First, for destination cities: since they're visiting 2 cities in Texas, I'll need to set those as the destinations. Then, initialize a Z3 solver, which is probably used for solving constraints in the code.

Next, departure dates: there are 5 days, so that's March 12th to March 16th. That means two transportations (since they start in Evansville and end in Texas after visiting two cities). So I'll set 'departure_dates' variables for these two trips.

Transportation methods: the user prefers avoiding airlines, so we'll use self-driving or taxi. The steps mention setting a variable for each transportation method and ensuring that only allowed methods are used.

Flight information is probably not needed here since they're avoiding flights, but I should still include it in case there's any data to handle, maybe just to exclude flight options.

Driving information will be more detailed because they'll be driving between Evansville and the two Texas cities. So I need to get driving distances and calculate costs for self-driving or taxi based on that.

For restaurants, since it's a 5-day trip with 3 meals each day, there are 15 meals to plan. The user didn't specify any cuisine preferences, so maybe this part is just about setting up the variables without additional constraints.

Attractions: one per day for 5 days, so 5 attractions in total. Again, no specific preferences mentioned, so it's more about structuring the data.

Accommodation information: they need entire rooms that allow parties, so I'll have to set constraints on room types and house rules when selecting accommodations.

Budgeting is straightforward: sum up transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs and ensure it doesn't exceed $9,500.

I should follow the structure from the examples, starting each step with a '#', and make sure each part is addressed systematically. I'll need to loop through cities for destinations, set variables for departure dates, handle transportation methods appropriately, gather necessary data for driving, restaurants, attractions, accommodations, and then calculate the total budget.

I think that's all. Now, let me structure this into the required steps.
