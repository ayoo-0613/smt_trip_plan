Can you help design a 5-day travel plan for a group of 4, starting from Evansville and visiting 2 cities in Texas? The trip spans from March 12th to March 16th, 2022. Our budget is now $9,500, and for accommodations, we require entire rooms that do not restrict parties. Also, note that we prefer to avoid airline transportation.
