Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me break down the query step by step.

First, the user provided a detailed example with three cases, so I should follow that structure closely. The main fields are org, dest, days, visiting_city_number, date, people_number, local_constraint, and budget.

Looking at the text: "Could you create a 7-day travel plan for a group of 8..." So, org is Rockford, dest is Florida, days is 7. Since days exceed 3, I need to check if there's a visiting_city_number mentioned. The text says "visiting 3 cities in Florida," so that's 3.

Next, the date: March 8th to March 14th, 2022. I'll format these dates as an array of strings in YYYY-MM-DD format. That would be ["2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", ..., "2022-03-14"].

People_number is clearly 8 from the text. Now, local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The user mentioned "accommodation preference is to have entire rooms," so room type is "entire room." There's no mention of parties, smoking, etc., or any specific cuisines, so those should be null. Transportation isn't discussed either, so that's null.

Budget is $17,000, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

I need to make sure all fields are present and only set constraints to null if not mentioned. So, the JSON structure will follow exactly what's in the examples, ensuring consistency.
