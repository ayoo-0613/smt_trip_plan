Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me break down the query step by step.

First, I'll identify the key components they mentioned: org, dest, days, visiting_city_number, date, people_number, local_constraint, and budget. 

Looking at the provided text, "departing from Lake Charles" means org is Lake Charles. The destination is Texas, so dest is Texas. They want to visit 2 cities there, so visiting_city_number is 2.

The trip lasts for 5 days, starting March 4th to March 8th, 2022. I'll format the dates as an array in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. 

There are 2 people traveling, so people_number is 2. The budget is $4,600.

For local constraints, they mentioned preferring places where parties are allowed. So under house rule, it's "parties". Other constraints like cuisine, room type, and transportation aren't specified, so those will be null.

I need to make sure all fields have values except for the ones that should be null. Also, the date format must be correct, and visiting_city_number is only included if days exceed 3, which it does here (5 days).

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly populated based on the text.

```json
{
    "org": "Lake Charles", 
    "dest": "Texas", 
    "days": 5, 
    "visiting_city_number": 2, 
    "date": ["2022-03-04", "2022-03-05", "2022-03-06", "2022-03-07", "2022-03-08"], 
    "people_number": 2, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": "parties", 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 4600
}
