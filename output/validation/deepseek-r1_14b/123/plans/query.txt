Could you assist in creating a 3-day travel plan for a duo, starting from Nashville and going to Detroit from March 15th to March 17th, 2022? Our budget is set at $2,200. We require accommodations that permit smoking and are looking for rooms that are not shared. We would prefer not to drive ourselves during this trip.
