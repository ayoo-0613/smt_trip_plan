Could you create a 5-day travel plan for a couple leaving from Baton Rouge and visiting 2 cities in Texas from March 16th to March 20th, 2022? We have allocated a budget of $2,900 for this trip. Important to note is that our travels will not involve any flights; we prefer other modes of transportation. For our lodgings, we insist on not shared rooms, and notably, we will be traveling with our pet, hence the need for pet-friendly accommodations.
