Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the constraints from this natural language query into code based on the examples provided. Let me start by breaking down the query step by step.

The user wants a travel plan from Houston to Pensacola for 3 days, starting March 12th to 14th, 2022. It's for two people with a budget of $1,100. They need accommodations that allow smoking and have non-shared rooms. Their preferred transportation isn't flights.

Looking at the examples, each step starts with a comment like "# Destination cities #" followed by specific instructions. I'll follow that structure.

First, destination cities: The query specifies Pensacola as the destination. So, I should set the cities list to include only Pensacola and loop through it once. Then, initialize the Z3 solver 's' and assert that the city variable equals the index of Pensacola in the list.

Next, departure dates: There are two transportations (departure from Houston to Pensacola and maybe return?), but since it's a 3-day trip, perhaps only one transportation is needed. Wait, no—maybe they're going and coming back? Or just staying in Pensacola. Hmm, the examples show 'n' transportations where n is the number of cities minus one. Since there's only one destination, maybe two transportations: arrival and departure.

Then, transportation methods: They prefer not to fly, so we'll set both transportations to self-driving or taxi. The constraints should ensure no flights are used.

Flight information: Even though they don't want flights, I need to check if any data is retrieved for flights just in case. So, run FlightSearch but assert that flight indices are -1 (not used).

Driving info: Calculate costs and times based on the distance from Houston to Pensacola.

Restaurants: They'll eat 3 meals a day for 3 days, so 9 meals total. Find restaurants in Pensacola that allow smoking if possible, but wait—the query says accommodations permit smoking, not necessarily restaurants. Maybe I don't need to set cuisine types here since it's not specified beyond the budget.

Accommodation: Need non-shared rooms and smoking allowed. So, when setting up accommodation constraints, ensure each has a private room and allows smoking.

Budget: Sum all costs (transportation, food, accommodation) and make sure it doesn't exceed $1,100.

I think that's the gist of it. Now, I'll structure each step as per the examples.
