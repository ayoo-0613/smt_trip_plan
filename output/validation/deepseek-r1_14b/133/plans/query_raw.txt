Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The departure city is Houston, and the destination is Pensacola. The trip spans 3 days from March 12th to 14th, 2022. There are 2 people traveling with a budget of $1,100.

Looking at local constraints: they mention smoking is allowed, so "smoking" should be under house rule. They want non-shared rooms, which translates to "not shared room". For transportation, it's specified as no flight, so that goes into the transportation constraint.

I need to make sure all fields are filled except where not mentioned. So, cuisine and other constraints remain null. The date format needs to be YYYY-MM-DD for each day.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly populated based on the text.
