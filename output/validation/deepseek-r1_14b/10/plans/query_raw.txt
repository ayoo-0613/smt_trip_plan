Alright, I need to extract information from the given text and structure it into JSON as per the user's instructions. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the departure city is Minneapolis, so "org" will be Minneapolis. The destination is St. Louis, so "dest" is St. Louis.

Next, the trip spans 3 days from March 15th to March 17th, 2022. So "days" is 3. Since it's exactly 3 days, "visiting_city_number" should be 1 because when days exceed 3, we specify the number of cities, but here it's exactly 3, so I think it's still 1.

The dates need to be formatted as an array in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. So that would be ["2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17"].

Looking for the number of people, the text mentions a group but doesn't specify how many. Since it's not mentioned, I'll set "people_number" to null as per instructions if not provided.

Now, checking local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any specific rules about parties, smoking, children, pets, or visitors. It also doesn't specify any preferred cuisines. For room type and transportation, there's no information either. So all local constraints will be null.

The budget is $1,000, so that goes into the JSON as "budget": 1000.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly placed and only necessary fields are included without any extra info.

```json
{
    "org": "Minneapolis", 
    "dest": "St. Louis", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17"], 
    "people_number": null, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1000
}
```
