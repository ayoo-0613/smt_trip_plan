I need assistance in crafting a 7-day travel plan for a group of 4 from Lexington to Texas. We plan to visit 3 cities in Texas from March 18th to March 24th, 2022. Please ensure that our lodging accommodations are suitable for children under 10 as we will be traveling with our younger ones. We have a budget of $16,800 for this trip.
