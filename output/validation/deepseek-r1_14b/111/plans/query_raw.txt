Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 7-day travel plan for a group of 4 from Lexington to Texas. They plan to visit 3 cities in Texas from March 18th to March 24th, 2022. Their budget is $16,800, and they need accommodations suitable for children under 10.

Starting with the JSON structure: "org" is Lexington, "dest" is Texas. The number of days is 7, so "days":7. Since days exceed 3, I need to check if there's a visiting city number mentioned. Yes, it's 3 cities in Texas, so "visiting_city_number":3.

Next, the date needs to be formatted as an array. March 18th is 2022-03-18, and March 24th is 2022-03-24. So I'll list all dates from 18th to 24th in order.

People number is clearly stated as 4, so that's straightforward.

Looking at local constraints: House rules mention children under 10, so "house rule": "children under 10". Cuisine isn't mentioned, so it remains null. Room type and transportation aren't specified either, so those are null too.

Budget is $16,800, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

I need to ensure all fields have values except where specified to be null. So, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field is correctly placed and formatted.
