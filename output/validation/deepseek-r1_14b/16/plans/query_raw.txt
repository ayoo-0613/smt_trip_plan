Alright, I need to extract information from the given text and structure it into JSON as per the examples provided.

First, identify "org" which is the departure city: Spokane.
Next, "dest" is San Francisco.
The trip spans 3 days, so "days": 3.
Since days are exactly 3, "visiting_city_number" should be 1.
Extracting the dates from March 3rd to March 5th, I'll format them as ["2022-03-03", "2022-03-04", "2022-03-05"].
The trip is for 1 person, so "people_number": 1.
Looking for local constraints: the text doesn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions. Therefore, all local constraints will be null.
Finally, the budget is $1,200.

I'll structure this into JSON accordingly, ensuring all fields are correctly filled and only necessary information is included without adding anything extra.

```json
{
    "org": "Spokane", 
    "dest": "San Francisco", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-03", "2022-03-04", "2022-03-05"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1200
}
```
