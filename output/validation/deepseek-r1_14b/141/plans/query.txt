Could you assist with a 5-day travel plan for a duo beginning from Las Vegas and proceeding to visit 2 cities within Texas, from March 13th to March 17th, 2022? Our budget is now set at $3,700. We require accommodations that allow pets and should ideally be non-shared rooms. In regards to cuisine, we'd like to taste American, Indian, Mediterranean, and Mexican dishes throughout our journey.
