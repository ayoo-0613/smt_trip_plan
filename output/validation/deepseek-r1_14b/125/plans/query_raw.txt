Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The departure city is New York, and the destination is Charleston. That's straightforward for "org" and "dest". Next, the trip spans from March 19th to March 21st, which is exactly 3 days. So "days" will be 3, and since it's not more than 3, I don't need to worry about visiting_city_number; it defaults to 1.

The date field needs to be an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. March 19th is 2022-03-19, and so on until the 21st. 

Looking at the people number, the text mentions 2 people, so that's easy.

Now for local constraints. The user requires accommodations that allow smoking, which falls under "house rule". They also specify not to have shared rooms, so "room type" is "not shared room". For cuisine preferences, they like French, Mediterranean, Mexican, and Chinese. I'll list all these in the "cuisine" array.

Transportation isn't mentioned, so that remains null. House rules only mention smoking, so other constraints like parties or pets aren't specified, hence null for those.

Budget is $1,600, which I'll include as an integer without the dollar sign.

I need to make sure all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated to be null. Also, check that the date format is correct and visiting_city_number is correctly set since days are 3.
