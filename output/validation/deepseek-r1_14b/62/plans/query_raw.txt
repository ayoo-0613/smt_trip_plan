Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text that needs to be converted into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll break down the requirements to ensure I don't miss anything.

The user wants me to extract information about the origin city ("org"), destination city ("dest"), number of travel days ("days"), visiting cities in the destination state ("visiting_city_number"), dates, number of people, and local constraints like house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, and transportation needs. If any of these aren't mentioned, they should be set to null unless it's a required field.

Looking at the example provided, I see that "local_constraint" has four subfields: "house rule", "cuisine", "room type", and "transportation". Each can have specific options or be null. The other fields like "people_number", "budget", etc., must always have values.

Now, let's analyze the given text:

- Origin city is Milwaukee.
- Destination is New York.
- Travel duration is 3 days from March 24th to March 26th, 2022.
- Number of people is two.
- Budget is $1900.
- They prefer non-shared rooms.

I need to map each piece of information correctly. 

For "org", it's straightforward: Milwaukee. "dest" is New York. Days are 3, so visiting_city_number should be 1 since the destination is a single city. Dates will be an array from March 24th to 26th.

People number is two. Budget is $1900.

Looking at local constraints:
- House rule: The text doesn't mention any specific rules like parties or smoking, so it's null.
- Cuisine: No preferences are stated, so null.
- Room type: They prefer non-shared rooms, which corresponds to "not shared room".
- Transportation: There's no mention of flight restrictions or self-driving, so null.

I should make sure that all required fields have values and only set constraints to null if they aren't mentioned. Also, the date format needs to be YYYY-MM-DD for each day in an array.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly populated based on the text provided.
