Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 7-day travel plan for a group of 5 departing from Provo to visit 3 cities in California. Dates are March 22nd to 28th, 2022, with a budget of $14,900 and accommodations that allow parties.

Starting with the JSON structure: "org" is departure city, so Provo. "dest" is destination state, which is California. Days are 7, so visiting_city_number should be 3 since it's within California. Dates need to be formatted as an array from March 22nd to 28th.

People number is clearly stated as 5. Budget is $14,900. Now for local constraints: house rule mentions parties, so that's "parties". Cuisine isn't mentioned, so null. Room type and transportation aren't specified either, so both are null.

I need to ensure all fields have values except where specified as null. The JSON should match the examples provided, with correct date formatting and proper structure for local constraints.
