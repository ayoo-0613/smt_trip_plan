We're seeking a 7-day travel plan for two persons, starting from Chattanooga and covering three different cities in Georgia. The travel dates are set between March 9th to March 15th, 2022. Our new budget is $6,900. We require accommodations that are neither shared nor subject to visitor restrictions and should be private rooms. For transportation, we'd rather avoid air travel.
