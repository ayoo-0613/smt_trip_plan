Could you generate a 7-day travel itinerary for 2 people? We would be leaving Salt Lake City and aim to visit 3 cities in California between March 25th and March 31st, 2022. We have a new budget of $4,600. When selecting accommodations, we require private rooms and it is important that smoking is permitted. As for transportation, we do not plan on self-driving.
