Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me break down the query step by step.

First, the user provided a sample text and three examples with corresponding JSON outputs. They want me to follow that format for another given text. The key fields are org, dest, days, visiting_city_number, date, people_number, local_constraint, and budget.

Looking at the new text: It starts in Pittsburgh and goes into 2 cities in Texas over 5 days from March 5th to 9th, 2022, for 7 people with a $16,100 budget. They mention accommodations that permit children under 10.

So, org is Pittsburgh, dest is Texas. Days are 5, visiting_city_number is 2 since it's two cities in Texas. The dates need to be converted into an array from March 5th to 9th, which would be ["2022-03-05", "2022-03-06", ..., "2022-03-09"]. People_number is 7.

For local constraints: house rule mentions children under 10. Cuisine isn't mentioned, so null. Room type and transportation aren't specified either, so those are null. Budget is $16,100.

I should make sure all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated to be null. Also, the date format needs to be YYYY-MM-DD for each day.
