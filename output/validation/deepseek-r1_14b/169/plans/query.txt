Can you assist me in planning a week-long trip for three people starting in Eau Claire intending to visit 3 unique cities in Illinois from March 20th to March 26th, 2022? Our budget tops out at $10,600. We are interested in local American, Chinese, French, and Italian cuisines. Please note, we won't require any flight transportation during this trip. Also, our accommodations need to permit visitors.
