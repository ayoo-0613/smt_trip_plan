Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants it converted into JSON following specific guidelines. First, I need to extract the relevant information from the given text.

Looking at the example texts, I see that "org" is the departure city, "dest" is where they're going, "days" is the total travel days, and if days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" comes into play. The date needs to be formatted as an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

In this case, the text says departing from Washington to Myrtle Beach for 3 days from March 13th to March 15th, 2022. So, org is Washington, dest is Myrtle Beach, and days are 3. Since days don't exceed 3, visiting_city_number isn't needed.

Next, the date needs to be converted into an array of three dates: 2022-03-13, 2022-03-14, and 2022-03-15. The budget is $1,400, so that's straightforward.

Now, looking at the local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any specific constraints like parties, smoking, etc., nor does it specify any preferences for food or accommodation types. It also doesn't talk about transportation options beyond departing from Washington to Myrtle Beach, which isn't a flight or self-driving scenario mentioned.

Therefore, all local constraints should be null except where specified. The user didn't mention anything about room type or transportation beyond the initial travel, so those stay as null too.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with org, dest, days, date array, people_number (which is 1 since it's for me), budget, and local constraints set to null where not specified. That should cover everything the user needs.

```json
{
    "org": "Washington", 
    "dest": "Myrtle Beach", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": null, 
    "date": ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1400
}
```
