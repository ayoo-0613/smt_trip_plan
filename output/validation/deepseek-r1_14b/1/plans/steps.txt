Okay, so the user has given me a natural language query about creating a travel plan and wants me to encode the constraints as code step by step. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand the query thoroughly. The user is departing from Washington and heading to Myrtle Beach for a 3-day trip from March 13th to March 15th, 2022. They have a budget of $1,400. 

Looking at the examples provided, each step starts with a comment indicating the section, like "# Destination cities #". So I should follow that structure.

Starting with destination cities: The user is going from Washington to Myrtle Beach. Since it's a 3-day trip and they're only visiting one destination city, Myrtle Beach. So in the code, I'll set the cities list to include just Myrtle Beach. Then loop through them for 1 destination.

Next, departure dates. There are two transportations: from Washington to Myrtle Beach and maybe another if there's a return or an internal trip, but since it's a 3-day trip, probably only one transportation. So I'll set the departure_dates variables for 2 transportations, with the first on day 0.

Transportation methods: The user doesn't mention flights, so likely using self-driving or taxi. But in the examples, they check all options. So I'll set variables for both and ensure that only one is used, not flight.

Flight information: Since the user prefers not to fly, I'll include a step where we run FlightSearch but assert that no flights are taken by setting flight_index to -1.

Driving info: This will be crucial since they're probably driving. I'll get the distance and calculate costs for self-driving or taxi based on that.

Restaurant information: They need to eat out three meals a day for 3 days, so 9 meals total. I'll set variables for each meal's city and cuisine type, ensuring they have American options as per their example.

Attraction info: They want to visit places in Myrtle Beach, so I'll get the attractions and plan one per day.

Accommodation: They need a place to stay in Myrtle Beach for 3 days. So set variables for that, check room type constraints, and calculate costs.

Budget: Sum up all expenses from transport, food, and accommodation, then assert it's within $1,400.

I think I've covered all the points. Now, structuring each step as per the examples.

# Destination cities #  
# Set cities to be a list includes Myrtle Beach only  
# Loop through cities for 1 destination cities  
# Initialize Z3 solver s  
# Set 'city' variable to be indexes of 1 destination cities  
# Assert 'city' variable equal to city index  

# Departure dates #  
# Set 'departure_dates' variables for 2 transportations between cities  
# Assert first transportation happens at first day (day 0), last transportation happens at last day (day 2)  

# Transportation methods #  
# Set transportation method (flight, self-driving, taxi) variable for 2 transportations between cities  
# Assert only one of flight, self-driving, or taxi is used for 2 transportations between cities  
# Assert all 2 transportations between cities are not flight  

# Flight information #  
# Run FlightSearch to get flight info for Washington as origin, list of cities, city_0, and dates ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15"]  
# Get specific flight price info with Washington as origin and final destination, specific city, and departure date for 2 transportations  
# Set 'flight_index' variable for 2 transportations  
# Assert 2 'flight_index' variables are within valid range if taking flight, assert flight index to be -1 if not taking flight  

# Driving information #  
# Run DistanceSearch to get driving info for Washington as origin and city_0  
# Get specific driving distance info with Washington as origin and final destination, specific city, and departure date for 2 transportations  
# Assert driving info is not empty if driving  
# Calculate self-driving and taxi price for 1 person and 2 transportations based on driving distance  
# Get driving arrival time with Washington as origin and final destination, specific city, and departure date for 2 transportations  

# Restaurant information #  
# Get arrivals and city list for each day based on 2 transportations, 3 total travel day, and departure dates variables  
# Run RestaurantSearch to get restaurant price info and cuisine info for city_0  
# Set 'restaurant_in_which_city' variables for 9 (3 meals per day, 3 days) meals  
# For each 'restaurant_in_which_city' variable, assert it to be either current city or next city based on transportation arrivals time  
# Set 'restaurant_index' variables for 9 (3 meals per day, 3 days) meals  
# For each 'restaurant_index', get specific price info based on 'restaurant_in_which_city' variable, assert index are within valid range, assert restaurants in same city are not repeated  

# Attraction information #  
# Run AttractionSearch to get attraction info for city_0  
# Set 'attraction_in_which_city' variables for 3 (1 per day) attractions  
# For each 'attraction_in_which_city' variable, assert it to be either current city or next city based on transportation arrivals time  
# Set 'attraction_index' variables for 3 (1 per day) attractions  
# For each 'attraction_index', get specific length info based on attraction in which city variable, assert index are within valid range  

# Accommodation information #  
# Run AccommodationSearch to get accommodation info and accommodation constraints for city_0  
# Set 'accommodation_index' variables for 1 (1 per city) accommodations  
# For each 'accommodation_index', get specific price info based on accommodation in which city variable, assert 'accommodation_index' variable are within valid range  
# For each city, get accommodation minimum night info and assert it to be less than the days stay in this city  

# Budget #  
# Set budget limit variable to be 1400  
# Add 2 transportation price to spent, according to whether transportation method is flight, self-driving, or taxi  
# Add restaurant price to spent  
# Add accommodation price to spent  
# Assert current spent is within budget
