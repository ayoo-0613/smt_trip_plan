Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 3-day itinerary for two people traveling from Newark to Savannah between March 3rd and 5th, 2022. Budget is $1400. They're traveling with children under 10, so that's a house rule. Their cuisine preferences are Mediterranean, Mexican, French, and Indian.

I need to map each piece of information to the JSON structure. "org" is Newark, "dest" is Savannah, days are 3. Since days don't exceed 3, visiting_city_number isn't needed, so it's null. The date should be an array from March 3rd to 5th.

People number is 2. For local constraints: house rule is "children under 10", cuisine includes the four mentioned, room type and transportation are null because they weren't specified beyond self-driving, which falls under transportation as "no self-driving". Budget is $1400.

I should ensure all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated to be null. Also, check that the date format is correct and the cuisine array includes all specified options without duplication.
