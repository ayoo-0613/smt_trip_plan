Okay, I need to create a step-by-step plan based on the given natural language query. Let me break down the problem.

First, the user is asking for a 3-day itinerary for two people traveling from Newark to Savannah between March 3rd and March 5th, 2022. They have a budget of $1,400. The trip includes children under 10, so accommodations must be suitable. Their dietary preferences are Mediterranean, Mexican, French, and Indian cuisines, and they want food recommendations for these. They also mention not planning to self-drive.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each step starts with a '#', and each line is a concise action. The steps cover destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, flight/driving info, restaurant, attraction, accommodation details, and budget checks.

So, starting with destination cities: since they're visiting Savannah only, it's just one city. Next, departure dates for two transportations (maybe arrival and departure flights). Transportation methods would exclude self-driving as per the query.

Flight information will involve searching from Newark to Savannah on those dates. Driving info isn't needed since they aren't self-driving. For restaurants, I need to ensure that each meal's cuisine matches their preferences and check availability in the cities visited. Attractions should be suitable for children. Accommodation must allow families with young kids.

Budgeting involves adding up transportation, food, and accommodation costs without exceeding $1,400. Each step needs to be clear and follow the structure of previous examples.

I'll outline each section methodically, ensuring all constraints are addressed: no self-driving, specific cuisines, child-friendly accommodations, and budget tracking.
