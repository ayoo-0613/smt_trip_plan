I need a 3-day travel itinerary for two people, departing from Newark and visiting Savannah from March 3rd to March 5th, 2022. We have a budget of $1,400. We'll be traveling with children under 10, so accommodations must be suitable for them. Our dietary preferences include Mediterranean, Mexican, French, and Indian cuisines, and we would appreciate food recommendations that cater to these preferences. Please note that we're not planning on self-driving.
