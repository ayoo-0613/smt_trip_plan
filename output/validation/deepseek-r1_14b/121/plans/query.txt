I need to organize a 3-day trip for a group of 3, departing from Asheville and arriving in Minneapolis. We will be traveling from March 7th to March 9th, 2022, with a total budget of $2,300. We require accommodations that allow pets and provide entire rooms. Regarding meals, our group enjoys a variety of cuisines, including Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, and American.
