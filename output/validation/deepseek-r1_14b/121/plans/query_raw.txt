Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The trip is for 3 days, starting from Asheville and ending in Minneapolis. The dates are March 7th to March 9th, 2022. There's a group of 3 people with a budget of $2,300. 

Looking at local constraints: they allow pets and require entire rooms. For cuisine, they enjoy Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, and American.

I need to map these details into the JSON structure. "org" is Asheville, "dest" is Minneapolis, days are 3, visiting_city_number is 1 since it's a single destination state. Dates will be an array from March 7th to 9th. People number is 3, budget is 2300.

For local constraints: house rule is pets, room type is entire room. Cuisine includes the four mentioned types. Transportation isn't specified, so it remains null.

I should ensure all fields are filled except where not mentioned. So, "house rule" gets "pets", "cuisine" has the list, and "room type" is set to "entire room". The rest are either null or extracted as per the text.
