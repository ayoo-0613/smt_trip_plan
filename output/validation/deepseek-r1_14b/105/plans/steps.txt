Okay, so I need to figure out how to construct a 7-day travel itinerary based on the given natural language query. The user is asking for a detailed step-by-step instruction to encode the constraints into code, similar to the examples provided.

First, let me parse the query carefully:

- **Duration**: 7 days
- **Group size**: 4 people
- **Departure city**: Monterey
- **Destination state**: Texas (3 cities)
- **Travel dates**: March 9th to March 15th, 2022
- **Budget**: $15,600
- **Food preferences**: French and Chinese cuisines

Looking at the examples, each step involves breaking down different aspects of the query into manageable parts. I'll need to follow a similar structure.

Starting with destination cities: Since the user wants to explore 3 cities in Texas, I'll set up a list of these cities. Then, loop through them as needed for accommodation and other services.

Next, departure dates: There are two transportations (Monterey to first city in Texas, then between Texas cities), so I need to set variables for their departure dates, ensuring they align with the 7-day itinerary.

Transportation methods: The user didn't specify, but since Monterey is on the west coast and Texas is far east, flights might be necessary. However, considering budget constraints, maybe driving or flying could be options. But in the examples, sometimes ground transportation was used even for long distances, so I'll set up variables allowing for flight, self-driving, or taxi.

Flight information: Since it's a cross-country trip, flights are likely. I'll use FlightSearch to get info from Monterey to each Texas city and between cities if flying.

Driving info: If driving is an option, calculate costs and times, but since the user allocated a budget, maybe ground transport isn't the focus unless specified.

Restaurants: Need to ensure that in each city, there are options for French and Chinese cuisines. So, I'll set up variables to check for these cuisine types across all restaurants.

Attractions: Each day should have one attraction, so 7 attractions total. They can be spread across the cities visited.

Accommodation: For each Texas city, find suitable places with private rooms if possible, but since it's a group of 4, maybe look for larger accommodations or multiple rooms.

Budgeting: Sum up all costs (transportation, food, accommodation) and ensure they don't exceed $15,600.

I think I've covered the main points. Now, structuring each step as per the examples.
