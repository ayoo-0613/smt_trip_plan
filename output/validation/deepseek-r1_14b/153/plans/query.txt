Could you assist with a 5-day travel itinerary for a group of 4, departing from Boston and visiting two cities in North Carolina from March 2nd to March 6th, 2022? Our new budget is $8,800. Our stay must accommodate visitors and provide entire rooms. It's also preferred that we don't self-drive for this trip.
