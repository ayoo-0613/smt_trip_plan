Alright, I need to extract information from the given text and structure it into JSON as per the user's instructions. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, I'll identify the departure city ("org") which is Colorado Springs. The destination state is Illinois, so "dest" will be Illinois.

Next, the trip duration is 5 days, from March 5th to March 9th, 2022. So, "days" is 5 and I need to list each date in the "date" array as ["2022-03-05", ..., "2022-03-09"].

The user mentions it's for a single traveler, so "people_number" is 1. 

Looking at local constraints: house rules aren't mentioned, nor are cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions. So all these should be null in the JSON.

Budget is $1,900, which I'll include as "budget": 1900.

I don't see any other details like visiting city numbers beyond what's given (2 cities in Illinois), so "visiting_city_number" is 2.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly placed and null where necessary.

```json
{
    "org": "Colorado Springs", 
    "dest": "Illinois", 
    "days": 5, 
    "visiting_city_number": 2, 
    "date": ["2022-03-05", "2022-03-06", "2022-03-07", "2022-03-08", "2022-03-09"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1900
}
```
