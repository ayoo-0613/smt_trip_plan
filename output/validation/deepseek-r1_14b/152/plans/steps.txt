Okay, so I need to plan a 5-day travel itinerary for a group of 7 people departing from Sun Valley and visiting two cities in California from March 14th to March 18th, 2022. The budget is $11,400, and we require accommodations that allow parties. We prefer not to fly between locations and look forward to enjoying Mediterranean, American, French, and Indian cuisines.

First, I'll start by identifying the destination cities in California. Since we're visiting two cities, I need to find possible destinations near Sun Valley but within California. Maybe places like Los Angeles or San Francisco? But wait, Sun Valley is actually a town in Idaho, so traveling to California from there would likely involve ground transportation.

Next, since we don't want to fly, the transportation between Sun Valley and California will probably be by car or bus. I'll need to consider the driving time and costs associated with that. Also, for each city we visit, we'll need accommodations that allow parties, so looking for hotels or venues with event spaces is important.

Accommodation-wise, since it's a group of 7, we might need multiple rooms or a larger space. But the key requirement is that they allow parties, so I should focus on places known for hosting events or having party-friendly environments.

For the itinerary, each day will have activities, meals, and possibly some attractions. Since we're visiting two cities, maybe spend a couple of days in each? Or perhaps explore different areas within California over the five days.

Cuisine is another important aspect. We need to ensure that during our stay, we can enjoy Mediterranean, American, French, and Indian foods. So I'll have to look for restaurants in each city that offer these cuisines. It might be challenging to find all four in one place, so planning meals across different dining spots will be necessary.

Budgeting is crucial here. The total budget is $11,400 for seven people over five days. That includes accommodation, transportation, food, activities, and maybe some attractions. I need to break down the costs to ensure we stay within budget. Transportation between cities by car might be more expensive than flying, but since we're not flying, it's a trade-off.

I should also consider the time spent traveling each day. If we're driving from Sun Valley to California, that could take several days, which might eat into our five-day itinerary. Maybe plan for arrival on March 14th and spend the nights in different cities accordingly.

Accommodation booking needs to be done early, especially since we need party-friendly places, which might have limited availability. I'll also check if there are any local events or festivals happening during that time which could affect our plans or offer unique experiences.

For each city, I'll outline the activities and dining options. For example, in Los Angeles, we can visit Griffith Observatory for views, explore Hollywood, and enjoy a variety of cuisines. In San Francisco, maybe visit Golden Gate Park, ride the cable cars, and experience the diverse food scene there.

I should also consider meal planning to stay within budget. Eating out seven times a day (three meals) might be expensive, so perhaps some meals can be packed or cooked if accommodation allows. But since we're in hotels, it's more practical to eat at restaurants.

Transportation between cities will likely involve renting a car or using buses. If we rent a car, that adds daily costs but gives us flexibility. Alternatively, using public transportation might save money but could limit our mobility.

Attractions and activities should be selected based on their cost and time requirements. Maybe prioritize must-see spots and skip the expensive ones if necessary.

Finally, I'll need to create a detailed day-by-day plan, including where we stay each night, what we do during the day, where we eat, and ensure that all expenses are accounted for within the $11,400 budget. It's a bit overwhelming, but breaking it down step by step should make it manageable.
