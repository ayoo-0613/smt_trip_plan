Could you plan a 5-day travel itinerary for a group of 7? We're set to depart from Sun Valley and aim to visit 2 cities in California from March 14th to March 18th, 2022. Our budget is now set at $11,400. In terms of accommodations, it is crucial that they allow parties. We also prefer to not fly between locations. On our trip, we look forward to enjoying a variety of cuisines, including Mediterranean, American, French, and Indian.
