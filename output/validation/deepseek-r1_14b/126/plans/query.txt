Could you construct a 3-day journey for two people from Chicago to Albany that takes place from March 22nd to March 24th, 2022? Our budget is $2,300. We require accommodations that allow smoking and should ideally be entire rooms. We will not be self-driving during this trip. On the subject of cuisine, we're open to any suggestions you might have.
