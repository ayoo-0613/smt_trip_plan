Okay, so I need to help plan a week-long trip for three people from Punta Gorda to three cities in Michigan between March 6th and March 12th, 2022, with a budget of $4,400. We want to try American and French cuisines.

First, I'll start by identifying the destination cities in Michigan. Using CitySearch, I'll get all possible cities there for the given dates from Punta Gorda. Then, I'll loop through these cities to select three distinct ones and set up variables for each city index using Z3 solver constraints.

Next, I need to handle departure dates. There will be two transportations (since we're moving between four points: start, city1, city2, city3). The first transportation is on day 0, and the last on day 6.

Transportation methods are flight, self-driving, or taxi. We'll set variables for each method and ensure only one is used per transportation, excluding flights since we don't want to fly.

For driving information, I'll use DistanceSearch to get details between Punta Gorda and each city, then calculate costs based on distance for self-driving or taxis.

Regarding restaurants, we need three meals daily for seven days, totaling 21 meals. Using RestaurantSearch, I'll find places serving American and French cuisines in each city. I'll set variables for each restaurant's location and ensure they're either current or next cities based on arrival times. Also, I'll check that each cuisine is available across all restaurants.

Attractions are next; we need one per day for seven days. Using AttractionSearch, I'll get info for each city and assign them to the correct days.

Accommodation-wise, since there are three cities, I'll set up three variables, ensuring they meet our budget and constraints (like private rooms).

Finally, I'll calculate the total budget by adding transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs, then ensure it doesn't exceed $4,400.
