Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 7-day travel plan for a group of 5 departing from La Crosse and visiting 3 cities in Illinois. Dates are March 18th to March 24th, 2022, with a budget of $4,800. They require accommodations suitable for children under 10 and want entire rooms. Also, they prefer no flights.

Starting with the JSON structure: "org" is La Crosse, "dest" is Illinois. Days are 7, so visiting_city_number is 3 since it's more than 3. Dates need to be in an array from March 18th to 24th, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

People number is 5, budget is 4800. Now for local constraints: house rule mentions children under 10, so that's set. Room type is entire room. Transportation prefers no flights, so that's specified. Cuisine isn't mentioned, so it remains null.

I need to ensure all fields are filled except where not mentioned. So the JSON should reflect these points accurately.
