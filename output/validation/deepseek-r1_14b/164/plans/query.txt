Can you create a 7-day travel plan for a group of 5, departing from La Crosse and visiting 3 cities in Illinois? The travel dates are from March 18th to March 24th, 2022, and our budget is now set at $4,800. We require accommodations that are suitable for children under 10 and would like to book entire rooms. We prefer no flights for our mode of transportation.
