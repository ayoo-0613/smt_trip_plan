Okay, so I need to figure out how to design a 3-day travel itinerary from Denver to Palm Springs for one person within a budget of $2,200. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the departure city is Denver, and the destination is Palm Springs. The travel dates are March 27th to March 29th, 2022. That's three days, so I guess that means two nights? Or maybe three days including arrival and departure. I'll need to clarify that.

Since it's a 3-day trip, there might be two transportations: one from Denver to Palm Springs and possibly another if there are stops or return trips, but the query doesn't specify any intermediate cities, so probably just a direct flight or drive.

The budget is $2,200 for one person. That includes transportation, accommodation, food, activities, etc. I should consider each of these expenses to make sure they fit within the budget.

Transportation: Options are flying, driving, or maybe taking a bus. Since Denver to Palm Springs isn't too far but also not a short drive (around 10-12 hours), flying might be more feasible unless the person prefers driving. I'll need to check flight prices for March 27th and 29th.

Accommodation: Looking for places in Palm Springs for two nights. Budget around $2,200 means maybe a mid-range hotel or an Airbnb. I should look for options that fit within this budget.

Food: Three meals a day times three days is nine meals. Eating out each time might be expensive, so perhaps some meals can be packed or found at local eateries. Need to estimate the cost here.

Activities: Palm Springs has attractions like hiking, spas, museums, etc. I should find free or low-cost activities to stay within budget.

Now, let's outline the steps based on the examples provided:

1. **Destination Cities**: Only Palm Springs is the destination.
2. **Departure Dates**: Two transportations (to and from), with departure dates March 27th and March 29th.
3. **Transportation Methods**: Since no flights are allowed, driving or bus itineraries will be planned.
4. **Driving Information**: Get driving distances and times between Denver and Palm Springs, calculate costs for self-driving or taxi.
5. **Restaurant Information**: Plan meals each day, ensuring variety and within budget.
6. **Attraction Information**: Select activities that fit the budget and are in Palm Springs.
7. **Accommodation Information**: Book a place in Palm Springs for two nights.
8. **Budget Calculation**: Sum up all expenses to ensure they don't exceed $2,200.

I need to make sure each step is detailed, similar to the examples given, ensuring that all aspects of the trip are covered without exceeding the budget.
