Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the departure city is Denver, so "org" should be "Denver". The destination is Palm Springs, so "dest" is "Palm Springs".

The trip spans 3 days, from March 27th to March 29th, 2022. So I'll list those dates in order under "date".

There's only one person traveling, so "people_number" is 1.

Looking at the local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. The user mentioned no specific constraints, so all these should be null.

The budget is $2,200, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

I need to make sure that "visiting_city_number" is 1 since it's a direct trip from Denver to Palm Springs with no intermediate cities mentioned. Also, since days are exactly 3, visiting_city_number defaults to 1 unless specified otherwise.

Double-checking all fields to ensure they're correctly mapped and nothing is missed.

```json
{
    "org": "Denver", 
    "dest": "Palm Springs", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-27", "2022-03-28", "2022-03-29"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 2200
}
```
