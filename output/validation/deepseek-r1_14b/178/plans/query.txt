We're planning a week-long trip with 2 people, starting in Key West and visiting 3 cities in Texas from March 3rd to March 9th, 2022. Our budget is set at $7,200 and we require accommodations that allow parties and where we have the entire rooms. As for dining, we would like to experience Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and American cuisines.
