Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully:

"We're seeking a 7-day travel plan for 2 individuals, beginning in Akron and involving a visit to 3 different cities in Georgia from March 23rd to March 29th, 2022. We have set aside a budget of $8,900 for our trip. During our adventure, we'd like to dine on American and Chinese cuisine."

Okay, let's identify each required field:

1. **org**: The departure city is Akron.
2. **dest**: The destination state is Georgia, but since the user mentioned visiting 3 cities within Georgia, "Georgia" should be the dest.
3. **days**: The trip spans from March 23rd to March 29th, which is 7 days.
4. **visiting_city_number**: Since it's a 7-day trip and they're visiting 3 cities in Georgia, this should be 3.
5. **date**: I need to list each day from March 23rd to March 29th, 2022. That would be five dates: 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Wait, that's seven days, so the JSON array should have all seven dates in order.
6. **people_number**: The text mentions 2 individuals, so this is 2.
7. **local_constraint**:
   - **house rule**: The text doesn't mention any specific rules like parties, smoking, etc., so it's null.
   - **cuisine**: They want American and Chinese, so these should be included as an array.
   - **room type**: No info given, so null.
   - **transportation**: No details provided, so null.
8. **budget**: The budget is $8,900.

Wait a second, in the examples, when days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" is included. Here, days are 7, which is more than 3, so we need to include it as 3 since they're visiting 3 cities in Georgia.

Also, for the dates, I should format them correctly as YYYY-MM-DD. So March 23rd becomes "2022-03-23", and so on up to March 29th.

I think that's all the necessary information. Now, I'll structure this into JSON, making sure each field is correctly placed and null where needed.

```json
{
    "org": "Akron",
    "dest": "Georgia",
    "days": 7,
    "visiting_city_number": 3,
    "date": ["2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25", "2022-03-26", "2022-03-27", "2022-03-28", "2022-03-29"],
    "people_number": 2,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": ["American", "Chinese"],
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 8900
}
