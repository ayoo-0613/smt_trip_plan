Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The departure city is Cincinnati, so "org" will be that. The destination is Philadelphia, so "dest" is set. The trip duration is 3 days from March 7th to 9th, 2022. Since it's exactly 3 days, "visiting_city_number" should be 1.

Next, there are two people traveling, so "people_number" is 2. The budget is $2,000, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

Now, looking at local constraints. The text mentions accommodations that allow children under 10 and require private rooms. So for "house rule", it's "children under 10". For "room type", it's "private room".

Transportation-wise, they're not planning to self-drive, so "transportation" is "no self-driving". Cuisine isn't mentioned, so that remains null.

I need to make sure all fields are filled except where specified. The date should be in an array with the correct format. I'll structure everything into JSON accordingly.
