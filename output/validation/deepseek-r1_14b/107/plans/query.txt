Can you help me design a week-long travel itinerary for a group of 5, departing from Washington and visiting 3 different cities in Indiana? The trip should last from March 23rd to March 29th, 2022, and our budget is set at $23,800. It's important to note that our accommodations need to be suitable for children under 10 years of age.
