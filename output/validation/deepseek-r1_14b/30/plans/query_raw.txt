Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read through the example they gave to understand how it's structured.

In Example 1, the JSON includes "org" as departure city, "dest" as destination, "days", "visiting_city_number", dates, people number, local constraints, and budget. The local constraints can have null if not mentioned, but other fields must have values.

Looking at the user's text: They want a travel plan from Key West to Indiana covering 2 cities, with dates from March 10th to 14th, 2022, and a $2,000 budget. 

First, I'll extract "org" as Key West and "dest" as Indiana. The days are from March 10th to 14th, which is 5 days. Since the trip covers 2 cities in Indiana, "visiting_city_number" should be 2.

Next, the dates need to be converted into an array of YYYY-MM-DD format: ["2022-03-10", "2022-03-11", "2022-03-12", "2022-03-13", "2022-03-14"]. 

The text mentions a group, but it doesn't specify the number of people. Since it's not mentioned, I'll set "people_number" to null as per instructions.

For local constraints: The user didn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions. So all these should be null.

Lastly, the budget is $2,000, so that goes into the JSON.

I need to make sure I'm following the structure exactly and only assigning null where necessary. Let me double-check each field to ensure nothing's missed.
