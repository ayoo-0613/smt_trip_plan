Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 5-day travel plan for two people leaving from Cedar Rapids and visiting two cities in Texas. The dates are March 11th to March 15th, 2022, with a budget of $2400. They require accommodations that allow visitors and enjoy certain cuisines. Also, they don't want any flights.

Starting with the JSON structure: org is Cedar Rapids, dest is Texas. Days are 5, so visiting_city_number is 2 since it's more than 3 days. The dates need to be formatted as an array from March 11th to 15th.

People number is 2. Now for local constraints: house rule mentions visitors, so that's set to "visitors". Cuisine includes Mediterranean, Indian, Italian, and Chinese, so I'll list those. Transportation says no flights, so that's "no flight".

Other fields like room type aren't mentioned, so they remain null. Budget is $2400.

I need to ensure all required fields are filled, only setting constraints to null if not present. Let me structure this into JSON accordingly.
