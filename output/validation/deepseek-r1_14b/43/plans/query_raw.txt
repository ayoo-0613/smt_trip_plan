Alright, I need to extract information from the given text and structure it into JSON as per the user's instructions. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the departure city is Kona, so "org" will be "Kona". The destination is California, so "dest" is "California".

Next, the trip duration is 7 days, which exceeds 3, so I need to check how many cities are being visited in California. The text mentions visiting 3 distinct cities, so "visiting_city_number" should be 3.

The dates are from March 7th to March 13th, 2022. I'll format these into an array of strings with the ISO date format: ["2022-03-07", ..., "2022-03-13"].

Looking at the number of people, it's a solo trip, so "people_number" is 1.

Now for local constraints. The text doesn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type requirements, or transportation restrictions. Therefore, all these fields under "local_constraint" will be null.

Lastly, the budget is $5,800, which I'll include as a number in the JSON.

I should ensure that all required fields are filled and only set constraints to null if they aren't mentioned. Everything else seems covered.

```json
{
    "org": "Kona", 
    "dest": "California", 
    "days": 7, 
    "visiting_city_number": 3, 
    "date": ["2022-03-07", "2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", "2022-03-10", "2022-03-11", "2022-03-12", "2022-03-13"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 5800
}
