Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I need to understand the structure they want.

Looking at the examples, I see that "org" is the departure city, "dest" is where they're going, "days" is the total travel days, and if days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" specifies how many cities in the destination state. The date field should be an array of dates.

Next, there's "local_constraint" with four possible constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. Each has predefined options, and if not mentioned, they should be null. Also, other fields like people_number and budget must have values.

Now, analyzing the given text: It starts in Jacksonville and goes through 3 cities in Massachusetts over a week (7 days) from March 22 to 28, 2022. The user is traveling solo with a $6,600 budget.

So, org is Jacksonville, dest is Massachusetts. Days are 7, which is more than 3, so visiting_city_number is 3. Dates will be an array from March 22 to 28.

Looking for local constraints: The text doesn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions. So all these should be null.

People number is 1 since it's a solo journey, and the budget is $6,600.

Putting it all together into JSON format as per the examples.
