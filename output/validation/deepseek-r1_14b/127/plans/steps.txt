Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the constraints from the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions using code. Let me start by breaking down the query.

The user is asking for a 3-day travel plan for a group of 3 people traveling from Daytona Beach to Atlanta between March 2nd and March 4th, 2022. They have a budget of $2,100. Their accommodation needs include places that allow children under 10 years old, and they prefer entire rooms. Also, they can't use flights for transportation.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each step involves setting up variables, asserting constraints, and calculating costs related to transportation, restaurants, attractions, and accommodations. So, I'll need to follow a similar structure.

First, I should identify the key components of the query:

1. **Duration**: 3 days.
2. **Travelers**: Group of 3.
3. **Departure and Arrival Cities**: Daytona Beach (departure) and Atlanta (arrival).
4. **Dates**: March 2nd to March 4th, 2022.
5. **Budget**: $2,100.
6. **Accommodation Requirements**: Allow children under 10; prefer entire rooms.
7. **Transportation Constraints**: No flights allowed.

Now, I'll map these components into the steps outlined in the examples.

Starting with destination cities: Since they're traveling from Daytona Beach to Atlanta, the main city is Atlanta. So, the destination list includes only Atlanta.

Next, departure dates: There are two transportations (Daytona to Atlanta and maybe another within Atlanta?), but since it's a 3-day trip, perhaps just one transportation? Wait, no—probably two transportations: leaving Daytona on March 2nd and arriving in Atlanta. Then, they might stay in Atlanta for the next days without further travel. So, departure dates would be set for these two transportations.

Transportation methods: They can't use flights, so only self-driving or taxi are options. But since it's a group of three, maybe self-driving is more economical.

Flight information: Since they can't use flights, this section will involve asserting that flight indices are invalid and using driving info instead.

Restaurant information: Need to ensure that the meals are in either Daytona or Atlanta, but since they're arriving on March 2nd, most meals might be in Atlanta. Also, no specific cuisine mentioned beyond what's required by their preferences, so maybe just ensuring variety.

Attraction information: They'll need attractions in Atlanta for each day.

Accommodation information: Need to find places in Atlanta that allow children under 10 and offer entire rooms.

Budget calculation will sum up transportation, food, and accommodation costs within $2,100.

I think I've covered all the points. Now, I'll structure this into steps following the examples.
