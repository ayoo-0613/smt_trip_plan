Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 3-day travel plan for a group of 3 starting from Daytona Beach and heading to Atlanta from March 2nd to March 4th, 2022. The budget is $2,100. They require accommodations that allow children under 10 and prefer entire rooms. Also, they can't use flights.

I need to map this information into the JSON structure provided in the examples. Let's break it down:

- "org" is the departure city, which is Daytona Beach.
- "dest" is Atlanta.
- "days" is 3.
- Since days are exactly 3, visiting_city_number isn't mentioned, so I think it defaults to 1 as per the first example.
- The dates need to be in an array. March 2nd to 4th would be ["2022-03-02", "2022-03-03", "2022-03-04"].
- People number is 3.
- Local constraints: House rule mentions children under 10, so that's set. Room type prefers entire rooms. Transportation can't use flights, so it's "no flight". Cuisine isn't mentioned, so null.

I should ensure all fields are filled except where specified as null. Budget is straightforward at $2,100.

Wait, in the examples, when days exceed 3, visiting_city_number is used. Since here days are exactly 3, maybe it's not needed, but looking back, the first example had 3 days and visiting_city_number as 1. So I'll include it as 1.

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Now, structuring this into JSON with proper formatting.
