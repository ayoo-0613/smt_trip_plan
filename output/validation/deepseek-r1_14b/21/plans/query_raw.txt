Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully. It says: "Could you help create a travel itinerary for a solo trip departing from St. Louis and covering 2 cities in Florida over the course of 5 days, from March 15th to March 19th, 2022? The travel budget is set at $2,900."

I need to identify each required field:

- **org**: This is the departure city. From the text, it's St. Louis.
- **dest**: The destination state or region. Here, it's Florida.
- **days**: Total number of travel days. The trip spans 5 days.
- **visiting_city_number**: Since days exceed 3, I need to check if the user mentioned visiting multiple cities in the destination state. They specified covering 2 cities in Florida, so this should be 2.
- **date**: Need to list each day from March 15th to March 19th, 2022. That's five dates.
- **people_number**: The user mentioned a solo trip, so it's 1 person.
- **local_constraint**: This has four subfields: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. I'll check the text for any mentions of these.

Looking through the text again, there are no specific constraints mentioned regarding parties, smoking, children, pets, or visitors. Similarly, there's no mention of preferred cuisines, room types (like entire room or private), or transportation restrictions like not self-driving or needing flights. So all local constraints should be null.

Lastly, **budget** is given as $2,900.

I need to ensure that each field is correctly mapped and that only necessary fields are included without any nulls unless specified. The JSON structure should mirror the examples provided, with proper formatting for dates and other values.
