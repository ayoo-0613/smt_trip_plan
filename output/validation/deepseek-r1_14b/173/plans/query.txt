I am interested in a 7-day travel plan for two people, starting from Fort Lauderdale and covering three cities in Louisiana from March 8th to March 14th, 2022. We have a budget of $4,400. We'd like accommodations that house children under 10 and we'd prefer to have entire rooms to ourselves. Also, we'd like to avoid flights as a mode of transportation for this journey.
