Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 7-day travel plan for two people starting from Fort Lauderdale and covering three cities in Louisiana. The dates are from March 8th to March 14th, 2022, with a budget of $4,400. They want accommodations that house children under 10 and prefer entire rooms. Also, they avoid flights for transportation.

I need to map this information into the JSON structure as per examples. Let's break it down:

- "org" is the departure city: Fort Lauderdale.
- "dest" is the destination state: Louisiana.
- "days": 7 days.
- Since days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" should be 3.
- Dates need to be listed as an array from March 8th to March 14th. I'll format them as YYYY-MM-DD.
- "people_number": 2.
- For local constraints:
  - House rule: They mentioned children under 10, so that's the value.
  - Cuisine isn't specified, so null.
  - Room type: They prefer entire rooms.
  - Transportation: They avoid self-driving, so "no self-driving".
  
Budget is $4,400. 

I should ensure all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated to be null. Let me structure this into JSON accordingly.
