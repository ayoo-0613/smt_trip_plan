Okay, I need to figure out how to encode the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions based on the examples provided. Let me start by breaking down the query.

The user is asking for a seven-day trip plan for two people traveling from Minneapolis to Illinois, visiting three cities between March 8th and March 14th, 2022. The budget is $8,100, and they require child-friendly accommodations with private rooms. They prefer not to fly, so non-flight transportation options are ideal.

Looking at the examples, each step starts with a '#' and follows a specific structure for different aspects like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, etc. I'll need to cover all these areas in order.

First, the destination cities: they're visiting three cities in Illinois. So, I'll list those cities and loop through them as per the examples.

Next, departure dates: there are seven days, so two transportations (start and end). The first transportation is on day 0, and the last on day 6.

Transportation methods: since they prefer non-flight options, I'll set both transportations to be either self-driving or taxi. Also, ensure that no flights are used.

Flight information: even though they don't want to fly, I still need to check for flight data, but mark flight indices as -1 because they aren't taking any flights.

Driving information: calculate costs and times based on the distance between Minneapolis and each of the three cities in Illinois. Make sure driving info isn't empty if they choose driving.

Restaurant information: plan meals for 3 people (wait, no, it's two participants). Wait, correction: the query says two participants, so all restaurant calculations should be for two people. Also, ensure that both American and Chinese cuisines are available each day by checking through the restaurants.

Attraction information: select one attraction per day in either the current or next city based on arrival times.

Accommodation information: find options in each of the three cities that are child-friendly and have private rooms. Check minimum nights stay and ensure room type is private.

Budget: sum up transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs, then assert that it doesn't exceed $8,100.

I think I've covered all aspects. Now, I'll structure each step accordingly, following the examples provided.
