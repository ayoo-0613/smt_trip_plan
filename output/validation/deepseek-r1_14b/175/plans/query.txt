Could you provide a seven-day trip planning for 2 participants from Minneapolis to Illinois, visiting 3 cities between March 8th to March 14th, 2022? Budget limit should be kept at $8,100. Our accommodations must be child-friendly for children under 10 and consist of private rooms. We prefer not to fly, so non-flight transportation options would be ideal.
