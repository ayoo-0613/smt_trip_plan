Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me break down the query step by step.

First, the user's text is: "Can you assist with a travel plan for one person departing from Pittsburgh to Baltimore for 3 days, from March 4th to March 6th, 2022, with a maximum budget of $1,200?"

I'll start by identifying each required field.

- **org**: The departure city is clearly stated as Pittsburgh.
- **dest**: The destination is Baltimore.
- **days**: It's mentioned as 3 days. Since it doesn't exceed 3, I don't need to set "visiting_city_number".
- **date**: The travel period is from March 4th to March 6th, 2022. I'll format these dates into an array.
- **people_number**: The user specifies it's for one person, so that's straightforward.
- **local_constraint**: The text doesn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation constraints. So all these should be null.
- **budget**: The maximum budget is $1,200.

I need to make sure each field is correctly mapped and follows the examples provided. Since there are no additional constraints mentioned, I'll set "local_constraint" fields to null as required.

Double-checking everything, it seems all necessary information is present and nothing extra is needed. Time to structure this into JSON.

```json
{
    "org": "Pittsburgh", 
    "dest": "Baltimore", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": null, 
    "date": ["2022-03-04", "2022-03-05", "2022-03-06"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1200
}
```
