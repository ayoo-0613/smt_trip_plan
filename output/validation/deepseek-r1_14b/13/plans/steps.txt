Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a detailed step-by-step instruction based on the given natural language query. The user is asking for a travel plan for one person traveling from Pittsburgh to Baltimore over 3 days, from March 4th to March 6th, 2022, with a budget of $1,200.

First, I'll start by identifying all the constraints in the query. The main points are:

- One person traveling.
- Departure city: Pittsburgh.
- Destination: Baltimore (specific city).
- Duration: 3 days.
- Dates: March 4th to March 6th, 2022.
- Budget: $1,200.

I notice that the user didn't mention any specific requirements about accommodation, restaurants, or transportation methods beyond the departure and destination cities. So, I'll need to make sure each step covers these aspects without assuming additional constraints unless specified.

Looking at the examples provided, each step starts with a '#' and follows a structure where each major category (like destination cities, departure dates) is addressed in separate steps. Each category has several sub-steps that detail the process.

So, I'll start by outlining the main categories:

1. Destination Cities
2. Departure Dates
3. Transportation Methods
4. Flight Information
5. Driving Information
6. Restaurant Information
7. Attraction Information
8. Accommodation Information
9. Budget

For each category, I'll need to create specific steps based on the query.

Starting with destination cities: The user is traveling from Pittsburgh to Baltimore, so the destinations are just Baltimore. Since it's a single destination, the step will involve setting the city list and initializing the solver.

Next, departure dates: There are 3 days, so two transportations (departure and arrival). I'll need to set variables for these dates and ensure they align with the travel period.

Transportation methods: The user didn't specify, but since it's a short trip, driving is an option. However, flights might also be considered. So, I'll set up variables for each transportation method and ensure only one is used.

Flight information: Since the user didn't mention flying, this step might involve checking flight data even if they prefer driving. Similarly, driving information will need to be gathered as a possible alternative.

Restaurant information: For three days, there are 3 meals per day, so nine meals in total. I'll set variables for each meal and ensure they're within budget constraints.

Attraction information: The user didn't specify any particular attractions, but the example includes checking for required types, which isn't applicable here. So, maybe this section is minimal or just a placeholder.

Accommodation information: Since it's one person, I'll need to find suitable options and calculate costs based on the budget.

Budget: Sum up all expenses (transportation, food, accommodation) and ensure they don't exceed $1,200.

I should follow each example's structure closely, ensuring that each step is clear and follows the same format. I'll make sure not to add any unnecessary steps but cover all necessary aspects based on the query.

Now, putting it all together in the required format with each line starting with '#'.

# Set budget limit variable to be 1200  
# Add 2 transportation price to spent, according to whether transportation method is flight, self-driving, or taxi  
# Add restaurant price to spent  
# Add accommodation price to spent  
# Assert current spent is within budget
