Okay, so I need to figure out how to design a one-week travel itinerary based on the given natural language query. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the user is asking for a 7-day trip for two people starting in Houston and visiting three cities in Tennessee from March 21st to March 27th, 2022. They have a budget of $8,200. Their special requirements include accommodations that allow smoking and ideally are private rooms. They also prefer not to self-drive.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each step involves encoding different aspects of the query into code. So, I'll need to follow a similar structure, starting with destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, and so on, until budget constraints.

Starting with destination cities: The user wants to tour three cities in Tennessee. So, I'll set the cities list to include these three cities. Then, loop through each city for processing.

Next, departure dates: There are 7 days, which means there will be two transportations (from Houston to first city and then between the other two cities). The first transportation should happen on day 0, and the last on day 6.

Transportation methods: They prefer not to self-drive, so I'll set the transportation method to exclude self-driving. That means only flight or taxi will be considered, but since they don't want to fly (as per their preference), maybe just taxi? Wait, no, in example 3, when they didn't want flights, they used driving info. Hmm, perhaps I need to check if the user prefers not to self-drive, so other options like flight or taxi are allowed.

Wait, looking back at the query: "As for transportation, we would prefer not to self-drive." So, they don't want to drive themselves but are open to other methods like flying or taking a taxi. So in the code, I need to set the transportation method variables to exclude self-driving.

Moving on to flight information: Since they might take flights, I'll run FlightSearch from Houston as the origin for each city and the given dates. Then, get specific flight prices and arrival times.

Driving information: Even though they prefer not to self-drive, perhaps we still need to consider it in case flights aren't available or more expensive. So, calculate self-driving and taxi prices based on distance.

Restaurant information: They want to experience different cuisines, but the query doesn't specify types, so maybe no cuisine constraints. But I'll set up variables for each meal and check if their preferences are met.

Attraction information: Similar approach as before, ensuring that each day's attraction is in the current or next city based on transportation times.

Accommodation information: They require smoking-friendly accommodations with private rooms. So, when setting up accommodation constraints, I'll ensure these conditions are met.

Budget: The total budget is $8,200. I'll sum up transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs and check if it's within the limit.

I think that covers all aspects. Now, I'll structure each step as per the examples, making sure to include all necessary details.
