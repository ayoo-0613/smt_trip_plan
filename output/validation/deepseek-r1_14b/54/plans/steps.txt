Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions based on the examples provided. The user wants a 7-day travel plan from Savannah visiting 3 cities in Texas with a budget of $3,200.

First, looking at the examples, each constraint is broken down into sections like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, etc., and each section has specific steps using Z3 solver variables. I need to follow that structure.

Starting with destination cities: The user wants to visit 3 different cities in Texas. So, I'll run a CitySearch from Savannah to get all possible cities in Texas for the given dates. Then, loop through them to select 3 distinct ones and set up Z3 constraints to ensure they are unique.

Next, departure dates: Since it's a 7-day trip with 3 cities, there will be 2 transportations (from Savannah to first city and then between the other two). I'll set 'departure_dates' variables for these 2 trips, ensuring the first is on day 0 and the last on day 6.

Transportation methods: The user didn't specify, so we assume they could use any method. But looking at the examples, sometimes flights are excluded if the user prefers driving. Here, since it's a long distance, maybe flights are allowed. So, I'll set variables for each transportation method and ensure only one is used per leg.

Flight information: Even though the user might take flights, I need to include steps for checking flight info from Savannah to each city on the required dates. Set 'flight_index' variables and calculate prices if flights are chosen.

Driving information: Similarly, check driving distances and costs between cities. Calculate self-driving or taxi prices based on distance and number of people (which isn't specified here; maybe assume 1 person? Or is it variable? The examples sometimes mention group size, so I might need to clarify that.)

Restaurant information: Need to plan for 3 meals a day over 7 days, totaling 21 meals. Use RestaurantSearch to get info on each city and set variables for each meal's location. Ensure variety by checking cuisine types if specified, but the user didn't mention preferences, so maybe just focus on availability.

Attraction information: Plan 1 attraction per day, spread over 7 days. Set variables for each attraction's location and index, ensuring they are unique within a city.

Accommodation information: Need to book one accommodation per city. Check constraints like room type and house rules. Calculate costs based on the number of nights required.

Budget: Sum up all transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs and ensure it doesn't exceed $3,200.

I think I've covered all sections. Now, I'll structure each step as per the examples, making sure to use Z3 variables appropriately and follow the format.

# For each 'attraction_in_which_city' variable, assert it is either current or next city based on transportation arrival times  
# Set 'attraction_index' variables for 7 attractions  
# For each 'attraction_index', get specific attraction details and ensure uniqueness within the same city  

# Accommodation information #  
# Run AccommodationSearch to get accommodation info for each city in Texas  
# Set 'accommodation_index' variables for 3 (1 per city) accommodations  
# For each 'accommodation_index', get specific price info based on selected cities  
# Calculate number of rooms needed and total accommodation cost  
# For each city, assert minimum night stay requirements are met  

# Budget #  
# Set budget limit variable to be 3200
