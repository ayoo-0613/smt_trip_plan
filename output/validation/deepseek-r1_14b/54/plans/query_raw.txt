Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. First, I'll read through the example they provided to understand exactly what they're looking for.

Looking at Example 1, I see that "org" is the departure city, "dest" is where they're going, "days" is the total travel days, and if days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" specifies how many cities in the destination state. The date field includes each day's date in order.

Then there's the "local_constraint" section with four possible constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. Each of these can have specific options or be null if not mentioned. Other fields like people_number and budget are straightforward.

Now, looking at the user's text: They want a 7-day plan from Savannah to Texas, visiting 3 cities, with dates from March 24th to March 30th, 2022, and a budget of $3,200. 

First, I'll extract "org" as Savannah and "dest" as Texas since they're planning to visit multiple cities there. The days are 7, which is more than 3, so "visiting_city_number" should be 3.

Next, the dates need to be converted into an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. From March 24th to March 30th, that's seven days: 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

The text doesn't mention the number of people, so I'll set "people_number" to null as per instructions. The budget is clearly $3,200, so that's straightforward.

For local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. The user didn't specify any of these, so each should be null. 

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all required fields are present with appropriate values or null where necessary.
