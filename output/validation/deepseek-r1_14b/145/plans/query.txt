Can you assist in crafting a travel itinerary for a pair of travelers originating from Milwaukee and visiting 2 cities in Michigan? The trip is 5 days long, spanning from March 21st to March 25th, 2022. Our budget is now set at $1,700, and we require accommodations that allow parties and provide private rooms. Moreover, we'd prefer if our transportation did not involve any flights.
