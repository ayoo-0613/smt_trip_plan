Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the constraints from this natural language query into code step by step. Let me start by reading the query carefully.

The user is asking for a 5-day travel itinerary for two people starting in Milwaukee and visiting two cities in Michigan. The trip dates are March 21st to March 25th, 2022, with a budget of $1,700. They require accommodations that allow parties and have private rooms. Also, they prefer not to use flights for transportation.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each step involves breaking down different aspects of the query into manageable parts: destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, restaurant info, attractions, accommodation details, and budgeting.

First, I'll handle the destination cities. Since they're visiting two cities in Michigan, I need to set those as the destinations. Then, I'll initialize a Z3 solver, which is used for solving constraints in optimization problems, probably to find the best itinerary within the given budget.

Next, departure dates: there are 5 days, so there will be four transportations between the starting point and each destination. The first transportation happens on day 0 (March 21st), and the last on day 4 (March 25th).

Transportation methods: they don't want flights, so I'll set the options to self-driving or taxi. I need to ensure that only these two methods are considered.

For restaurant information, since it's a 5-day trip with three meals each day, there will be 15 meals in total. I'll need to find restaurants in the current and next cities based on transportation times. Also, they didn't specify any cuisine preferences beyond what's allowed, so maybe just ensure that the restaurants are suitable.

Attractions: one per day for five days, so five attractions in total. These should be located either in the current city or the next city depending on transportation schedules.

Accommodation information is crucial here. They require private rooms and accommodations that allow parties. So I'll need to filter out any options without these features. Also, check the minimum nights required for each accommodation to ensure it fits within their stay duration.

Finally, budgeting: set the limit at $1,700 and sum up all transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs to make sure they don't exceed this amount.

I think I've covered all aspects. Now, I'll structure these thoughts into the required step format.
