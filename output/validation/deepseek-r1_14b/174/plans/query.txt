I'm helping you plan a 7-day trip for two people from North Platte to Colorado, exploring three cities, starting from March 20 to March 26, 2022. The trip allocation would be a budget of $6,500. When it comes to lodging, we prefer accommodations where parties are allowed, and non-shared rooms are a must for us. As for transportation, we're aiming to exclude flight options.
