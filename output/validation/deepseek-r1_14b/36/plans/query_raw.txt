Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully: "Could you please create a 5-day travel plan for me, starting from Los Angeles and visiting 2 cities in Colorado between March 13th and March 17th, 2022? My budget for the trip is $4,700."

I need to identify each required field. 

Starting with "org" which is the departure city. The text mentions starting from Los Angeles, so that's straightforward.

Next, "dest" is the destination. It says visiting 2 cities in Colorado, so the destination state is Colorado.

The number of days is given as 5, so "days": 5.

Since "days" exceeds 3, I need to check if there's a "visiting_city_number". The text explicitly mentions visiting 2 cities, so that's 2.

For the date, it's from March 13th to March 17th. I'll convert these dates into the format ["YYYY-MM-DD", ...]. That would be ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17"].

Looking for the number of people, but the text doesn't mention it. So I'll set "people_number": null as per instructions to assign null if not mentioned.

Now, checking local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't specify any of these, so all will be null.

Lastly, the budget is $4,700, which I'll include as "budget": 4700.

I should make sure that all fields are present and correctly formatted, especially dates in YYYY-MM-DD order. Also, ensure that if a field isn't mentioned, it's set to null except for other required fields which must have values.

Double-checking the examples provided, I see that when visiting cities are specified, "visiting_city_number" is included even if days exceed 3. So including it here is correct.

I think that covers all necessary parts. Now, I'll structure this into JSON as per the user's example.

```json
{
    "org": "Los Angeles", 
    "dest": "Colorado", 
    "days": 5, 
    "visiting_city_number": 2, 
    "date": ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17"], 
    "people_number": null, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 4700
}
```
