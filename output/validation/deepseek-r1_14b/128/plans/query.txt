Could you help design a travel plan for two people leaving from Houston to Pensacola for 3 days, from March 6th to March 8th, 2022? Our budget is set at $1,400 for this trip and we require our accommodations to be visitor-friendly. We would like to have options to dine at Indian, American, Chinese, and Italian restaurants. We also prefer not to self-drive during the trip.
