Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions based on the examples provided. Let me start by breaking down the query.

The user is asking for a 3-day travel plan from March 17th to March 19th, 2022, for 8 people traveling from Denver to Bozeman. The budget is $7,000, and they enjoy American and Indian cuisines.

Looking at the examples, each step starts with a '#' and follows a specific structure addressing different aspects like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, etc. I'll need to cover all these areas but tailored to this query.

First, since the destination is Bozeman, which is a single city, the steps for destination cities will be straightforward—just setting it as a list with Bozeman. Then, moving on to departure dates, there are two transportations (from Denver to Bozeman and maybe within Bozeman if needed), but in this case, since it's a direct trip, probably just one transportation.

Transportation methods: They don't want flights, so only self-driving or taxi. But considering the distance from Denver to Bozeman, driving might be feasible, so I'll set the method accordingly and ensure no flights are involved.

For each section like restaurants, since they have specific cuisines, I need to include steps that check for American and Indian options in the restaurant search. Similarly, attractions would be within Bozeman, so I'll make sure those are covered.

Budgeting is crucial here. The total should not exceed $7,000, so adding up transportation, food, and accommodation costs correctly is important. Each step needs to reference these aspects without going over the limit.

I also need to ensure that each part of the query is addressed: group size (8 people), departure city (Denver), destination (Bozeman), dates, budget, and cuisine preferences. 

Let me structure this step by step, making sure each example's format is followed precisely, starting each line with '#', and covering all necessary components without missing any details.
