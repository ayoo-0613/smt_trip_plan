Can you assist in creating a travel plan that commences in Atlanta, heading to Knoxville for a duration of 3 days, from March 29th to March 31st, 2022. For our accommodations, we are aiming for private rooms that accommodate children under the age of 10. Please note that we'll not be engaging in any self-driving. Overall, we are hoping to stay within a budget of $1,000.
