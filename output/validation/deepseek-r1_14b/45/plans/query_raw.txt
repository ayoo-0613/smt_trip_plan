Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me break down the query step by step.

First, the user's text says they're departing from Devils Lake and heading to Colorado, covering 3 cities. So, "org" should be Devils Lake, and "dest" is Colorado. The trip duration is one week, which is 7 days, so "days": 7. Since days exceed 3, I need to check if there's a visiting city number mentioned. The text mentions covering 3 cities in Colorado, so "visiting_city_number": 3.

Next, the dates are from March 22nd to March 28th, 2022. I'll format these into an array of strings with the ISO date format: ["2022-03-22", ..., "2022-03-28"]. The trip is for a single person, so "people_number": 1.

Looking at local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any specific rules like parties or smoking, nor does it specify cuisine preferences. There's no info on room type or transportation restrictions either. So all local constraints will be null.

Lastly, the budget is $3,500, so I'll include that as "budget": 3500.

I should make sure each field is correctly mapped and only necessary fields are included. Also, since none of the local constraints are mentioned, they remain null.
