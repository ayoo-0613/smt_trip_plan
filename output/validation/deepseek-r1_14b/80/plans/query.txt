I need assistance with organizing a 3-day trip for two people from Atlanta to Chicago, visiting just one city at the destination. The journey starts on March 24th and ends on March 26th, 2022. The revised budget for this trip is $1,900. We require accommodations that will provide us with entire rooms for our stay. Could you please help with this?
