Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 3-day trip from Atlanta to Chicago for two people. They're visiting just one city in Chicago. Dates are March 24th to 26th, 2022. Budget is $1900. They require entire rooms for accommodation.

I need to map this into the JSON structure. "org" is Atlanta, "dest" is Chicago. Days are 3, so visiting_city_number is 1 since it's only one city in the destination. Dates should be formatted as an array: ["2022-03-24", "2022-03-25", "2022-03-26"]. People number is 2.

Looking at local constraints, they specified entire rooms, so room type is "entire room". No mention of house rules, cuisine, or transportation restrictions, so those should be null. Budget is $1900.

I need to ensure all fields are filled except where it's explicitly stated that if not mentioned, set to null. So the JSON should reflect these details accurately.
