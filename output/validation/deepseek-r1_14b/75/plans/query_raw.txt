Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. First, I'll read the provided text carefully.

The text says: "Could you create a 3-day travel itinerary for a party of 2, from Jacksonville to Washington between March 3rd and March 5th, 2022, with a budget of $1,000? Please note we're looking for accommodations where parties are allowed."

Starting with the basics: "org" is the departure city, which is clearly Jacksonville. The destination is Washington, so "dest" will be Washington.

Next, the number of days is mentioned as 3, so "days": 3. Since days are exactly 3, I don't need to worry about "visiting_city_number" unless it's specified. In this case, it's not mentioned, so I'll leave it out or set it to null if required.

Looking at the date: March 3rd to March 5th, 2022. I'll format these dates as an array in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, resulting in ["2022-03-03", "2022-03-04", "2022-03-05"].

The number of people is 2, so "people_number": 2. The budget is $1,000, which I'll include as "budget": 1000.

Now, the local constraints. The user mentioned they're looking for accommodations where parties are allowed. From their examples, "house rule" includes options like "parties". So under "local_constraint", "house rule" should be set to "parties".

Other constraints like cuisine, room type, and transportation aren't mentioned, so those will remain null.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly placed. I need to make sure that only necessary fields are included and others are set to null as per instructions.
