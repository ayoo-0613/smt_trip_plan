Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the departure city, "Eugene" is clearly mentioned as the starting point. The destination is "Los Angeles," so that's straightforward for "org" and "dest."

Next, the trip duration is 3 days, from March 14th to March 16th, 2022. I'll need to format the dates correctly into an array.

The user specified it's for two people, so "people_number" should be 2. The budget is $1,700, which goes directly into the JSON under "budget."

Now, looking at local constraints. They mentioned they require entire rooms, so under "house type," I'll set that to "entire room." There's no mention of parties, smoking, children, or pets, so "house rule" remains null. Similarly, cuisine isn't specified, so that's null too. For transportation, since there's no restriction mentioned, it stays null as well.

I should make sure all fields are filled except where the text doesn't provide info, and only set constraints to null if they aren't mentioned. Everything else seems covered.

```json
{
    "org": "Eugene", 
    "dest": "Los Angeles", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-14", "2022-03-15", "2022-03-16"], 
    "people_number": 2, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": "entire room", 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1700
}
```
