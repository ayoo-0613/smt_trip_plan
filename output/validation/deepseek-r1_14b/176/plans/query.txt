I need assistance in planning a week-long vacation for 2 individuals, starting from Chattanooga and covering 3 cities in Georgia. This trip will span from March 24th to March 30th, 2022, with a budget cap at $6,800. We'll be traveling with our children who are under 10 years old, hence, accommodations must be children-friendly and should ideally be entire rooms. For this trip, we would prefer not to take any flights.
