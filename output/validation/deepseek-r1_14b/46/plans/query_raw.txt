Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the departure city. The text says "Charlotte in North Carolina," so "org" should be "Charlotte."

Next, the destination is Pennsylvania, so "dest" is "Pennsylvania." 

The trip duration is 7 days, from March 6th to March 12th. That makes sense because subtracting the dates gives exactly 7 days.

Since the user mentions visiting 3 cities in Pennsylvania, "visiting_city_number" should be 3.

The date field needs each day as a string in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. So I'll list all seven dates accordingly.

There's only one person traveling, so "people_number" is 1.

Now, checking the local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. The text doesn't mention any specific rules about parties, smoking, etc., nor does it specify cuisine preferences or room type requirements. It also doesn't talk about transportation restrictions like not self-driving or needing flights. So all these should be null.

Lastly, the budget is $5,100, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

I need to make sure that each field is correctly placed and follows the examples provided. Also, since none of the local constraints are mentioned, they remain null except where specified in the text, but in this case, there's nothing to add.
