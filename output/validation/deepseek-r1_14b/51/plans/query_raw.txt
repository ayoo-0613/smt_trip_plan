Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read through the example they gave to understand exactly what they need.

In Example 1, the JSON includes "org" as departure city, "dest" as destination, "days", "visiting_city_number", dates, people number, local constraints, and budget. The local constraints can have null if not mentioned. So I need to make sure all these fields are present with appropriate values.

Looking at the given text: It's a week-long trip starting from Indianapolis through 3 cities in North Carolina from March 7th to 13th, 2022. Budget is $6,500 for one person.

First, extract "org" as Indianapolis and "dest" as North Carolina since it's the state with multiple cities. The trip duration is a week, so 7 days. Visiting city number is 3. Dates need to be converted into an array from March 7th to 13th, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

People number is 1. Now, checking local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any specific rules like parties or smoking, nor does it specify cuisine preferences. There's no info on room type or transportation restrictions. So all local constraints should be null.

Budget is straightforward at $6,500. I need to ensure that the JSON structure matches the examples exactly, with each field present and correctly formatted. Also, make sure dates are in order without any gaps since it's a consecutive week.

I think that covers everything. Now, putting it all together into the JSON format as specified.
