Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I need to understand the structure they want.

Looking at the examples, I see that "org" is the departure city, "dest" is where they're going, "days" is the total travel days, and if days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number" specifies how many cities in the destination state. The date field should be an array of dates.

Next, there's "local_constraint" with four possible constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. Each has predefined options, and if not mentioned, they should be null. Also, other fields must have values, so I can't leave any empty unless specified.

Now, looking at the provided text: It starts in Palm Springs and ends in Texas over 7 days, visiting 3 cities from March 13th to 19th, with a budget of $8,100. 

First, extract "org" as Palm Springs and "dest" as Texas. The trip spans 7 days, so "days":7. Since days exceed 3, "visiting_city_number":3.

For the dates, I need to list each day from March 13th to 19th in YYYY-MM-DD format. That gives me five dates: 2022-03-13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

The budget is straightforward at $8,100. 

Now, checking for local constraints: The text doesn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions. So all these should be null in the JSON.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each field filled as per the examples, ensuring that only necessary fields are included and others are set to null where applicable.

        "cuisine": null,

    }, 
    "budget": 8100
