Could you create a 7-day travel itinerary for 2 people, departing from Albuquerque and visiting 3 cities in Texas from March 8th to March 14th, 2022? Our budget is set at $5,000. We require accommodations that allow smoking and are preferably not shared rooms. We would prefer to avoid any flights for our transportation.
