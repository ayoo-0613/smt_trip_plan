Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a 7-day itinerary for two people departing from Albuquerque and visiting three cities in Texas. The dates are from March 8th to March 14th, 2022, with a budget of $5,000. They have specific local constraints: accommodations should allow smoking and preferably not be shared rooms. Also, they want to avoid flights for transportation.

Starting with the JSON structure, "org" is Albuquerque, and "dest" is Texas since it's the destination state. The number of days is 7, so "days":7. Since days exceed 3, I need to check if there are visiting cities mentioned. Yes, they're visiting 3 cities in Texas, so "visiting_city_number":3.

Next, the dates. March 8th to March 14th gives us seven days: 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I'll format these as an array with the year included.

"people_number":2 since it's for two people. Now, looking at local constraints. House rules mention smoking, so "house rule":"smoking". For room type, they prefer not shared rooms, which translates to "not shared room". Transportation constraint is avoiding flights, so "no flight".

Cuisine isn't mentioned, so that remains null. Budget is $5,000, so I'll include that as a number without the dollar sign.

I need to ensure all fields are filled except where specified as null. Let me double-check each part against the examples provided to make sure I'm following the structure correctly.
