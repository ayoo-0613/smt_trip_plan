Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the constraints from the given natural language query into detailed step-by-step instructions using code. Let me start by breaking down the query and understanding each part.

The user is asking for a 3-day travel plan for a group of 7 people traveling from Appleton to Charlotte. The trip dates are March 18th to March 20th, 2022, with a budget of $9,500. They also mention that the accommodations should allow visitors according to the house rules.

First, I'll identify the key components in the query:

1. **Departure and Destination**: The trip starts in Appleton and ends in Charlotte. So, there's only one destination city here, which is Charlotte.

2. **Duration**: It's a 3-day trip, so we're looking at March 18th (day 0), 19th (day 1), and 20th (day 2). That means there are two transportations: from Appleton to Charlotte on day 0 and possibly another movement within the trip, but since it's a departure and arrival, maybe just one transportation.

3. **Group Size**: There are 7 people in the group, which affects costs for accommodations, food, and transportation.

4. **Budget**: The total budget is $9,500, so all expenses—transportation, food, attractions, and accommodation—must stay within this limit.

5. **Accommodation Requirements**: The accommodations must allow visitors as per the house rules. This likely means no restrictions on the number of guests or specific policies that would prevent having additional visitors.

Now, looking at the examples provided, each step starts with a '#' and follows a structure where each constraint is addressed in order: destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, flight/driving info, restaurant info, attraction info, accommodation info, and budget. 

I'll need to follow this structure but adapt it to the specific details of the current query.

Starting with destination cities, since the trip is from Appleton to Charlotte, the only destination city is Charlotte. So, I'll set the cities list accordingly.

Next, departure dates: there are two transportations needed—departure and arrival. The first transportation happens on day 0 (March 18th), and the second on day 2 (March 20th).

Transportation methods: Since the user doesn't want to take flights, we'll use self-driving or taxi. So, I need to set variables for these methods and ensure they're not using flights.

For driving information, I'll run a search for distances between Appleton and Charlotte on the specified dates. Then calculate costs based on the number of people (7) and the distance.

Restaurant info: We need to plan meals for 3 days with 3 meals each day, totaling 9 meals. The restaurants should be in either Appleton or Charlotte, depending on transportation times. I'll set variables for each meal's location and cuisine type, ensuring that all required cuisines are covered.

Attraction information: There are 3 days, so we need to plan one attraction per day. These attractions can be in the current or next city based on transportation arrival times.

Accommodation info: We're staying in Charlotte, so I'll search for accommodations there. Need to ensure they allow visitors and meet the group size requirements. Calculate costs and check minimum nights stay.

Finally, budgeting: Sum up all expenses (transportation, food, attractions, accommodation) and ensure it doesn't exceed $9,500.

I think that covers all aspects. Now, I'll structure each step accordingly, making sure to follow the example format.
