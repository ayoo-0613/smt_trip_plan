Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read through the example they gave to understand how it's structured.

In Example 1, the JSON includes "org" as departure city, "dest" as destination, "days", "visiting_city_number", dates, people number, local constraints, and budget. The local constraints have four possible options, each with specific allowed values or null if not mentioned.

Looking at the new text: It's a group of 7 traveling from Appleton to Charlotte for 3 days from March 18th to 20th, 2022. Budget is $9,500. They mention accommodations should allow visitors as per house rules.

So, I'll start by extracting each piece:

- org: Appleton
- dest: Charlotte
- days: 3
- visiting_city_number: Since it's a 3-day trip and the destination is Charlotte (a single city), this should be 1.
- date: March 18th to 20th, so three dates in order.
- people_number: 7
- local_constraint: House rule mentions "allow visitors", which corresponds to "visitors" in the options. Other constraints aren't mentioned, so they'll be null.

Budget is straightforward at $9,500.

I need to make sure all fields are filled except where it's specified that null can be used. Also, check if visiting_city_number applies when days exceed 3, but here days are exactly 3, so it's just the destination city.

Putting it all together into JSON format as per examples.
