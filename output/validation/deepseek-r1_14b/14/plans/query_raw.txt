Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. First, I'll read the example they provided to understand exactly what they're looking for.

Looking at Example 1, the key fields are "org" (departure city), "dest" (destination), "days", "visiting_city_number", "date", "people_number", "local_constraint", and "budget". The local constraints have four possible options: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. Each of these can be null if not mentioned.

Now, the user provided a new text to process. Let's break it down:

- The trip starts from Denver, so "org" is Denver.
- The destination is Appleton, so "dest" is Appleton.
- The duration is 3 days, so "days": 3.
- Since the days are exactly 3 and not exceeding, I don't need to set "visiting_city_number". It should be null or maybe omitted? Wait, in Example 1, it was set to 1 because they were going from St. Petersburg to Rockford, which is one city. So perhaps when the destination is a single city, visiting_city_number is 1. But in this case, Appleton is the only destination, so "visiting_city_number": 1.
- The dates are March 4th to March 6th, 2022. I'll format these as ["2022-03-04", "2022-03-05", "2022-03-06"].
- The user is traveling alone, so "people_number": 1.
- Checking for local constraints: the text doesn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions. So all these should be null in the JSON.
- Budget is $1,800.

Wait, but in Example 3, when visiting multiple cities, "visiting_city_number" was set to 2. So for this case, since it's a single destination city, I think it's appropriate to set it to 1. Alternatively, maybe if the destination is a state or larger area, but Appleton seems like a specific city. So yes, visiting_city_number: 1.

I should also ensure that all fields are present except where they can be null. The user emphasized that only local constraints can be null; other fields must have values. So I'll include "visiting_city_number" even if it's 1, as in the examples.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will follow the same format as the examples, with each field appropriately filled or set to null where necessary.
