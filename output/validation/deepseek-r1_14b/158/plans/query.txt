Can you assist in preparing a 5-day travel plan for two individuals, departing from Fort Lauderdale and visiting 2 cities in Texas? The travel dates should be from March 5th to March 9th, 2022, with a budget cap of $4,200. We're open to variety when it comes to food, preferring Indian, Italian, Chinese, or Mediterranean cuisines. It's important to note that we'd like accommodations allowing parties since we're planning to host them. Kindly note that we aren't intending to drive ourselves during the trip.
