Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the user's query is about creating a travel itinerary. The text mentions starting in Oakland and heading to Tucson for 3 days, from March 15th to 17th, with a budget of $1400 for one person.

Looking at the JSON structure examples, I see that "org" is the departure city, which here is Oakland. "Dest" is the destination, so that's Tucson. The number of days is clearly stated as 3, and since it's exactly 3, "visiting_city_number" should be 1.

The dates need to be formatted into an array with each date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. So March 15th becomes "2022-03-15", and so on until the 17th.

There's only one person, so "people_number" is 1. Now, checking for local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any specific rules like parties or smoking, nor does it specify cuisine preferences. It also doesn't talk about room type or transportation restrictions beyond the travel dates. So all these should be null.

The budget is straightforward at $1400. I need to make sure all fields are filled except where specified as null if not mentioned.

I think that's all. Let me structure this into JSON accordingly.

```json
{
    "org": "Oakland", 
    "dest": "Tucson", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1400
}
```
