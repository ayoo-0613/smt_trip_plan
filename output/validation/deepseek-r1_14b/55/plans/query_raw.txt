Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from their text and format it into JSON as per the given examples. First, I'll read through the provided text carefully.

The text says: "Could you help me create a 7-day travel plan starting on March 18th, 2022, and ending on March 24th, 2022? The trip will start in Washington and I would like to visit 3 cities in Minnesota. This trip is for one person with a budget of $7,200."

Starting with the basics, "org" is the departure city, which here is Washington. The destination is Minnesota, so "dest" should be Minnesota.

Next, the number of days. They mentioned a 7-day plan, so "days": 7. Since days exceed 3, I need to check if there's a visiting city number. Yes, they want to visit 3 cities in Minnesota, so "visiting_city_number": 3.

For the dates, it starts on March 18th and ends on March 24th. That gives us seven days: 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. I'll format these as an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

The trip is for one person, so "people_number": 1. Now, looking at the local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any specific rules about parties, smoking, children, pets, or visitors. It also doesn't specify any preferred cuisines. However, they do mention that it's for one person, but there's no info on room type preferences like entire room or private room. Transportation-wise, nothing is specified either.

So, all local constraints should be null except where explicitly mentioned. In this case, none are provided, so each constraint remains null.

Lastly, the budget is $7,200, which I'll include as "budget": 7200 in the JSON.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these fields, ensuring that all required fields have values and only necessary constraints are included. This should meet the user's requirements accurately.
