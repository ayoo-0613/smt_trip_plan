Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text says: "Could you craft a 7-day travel itinerary for a group of three starting in Peoria and planning to visit three different cities within Illinois from March 13th to March 19th, 2022? We have a set budget of $8,400 and require accommodations that allow children under 10."

Starting with the basics: "org" is the departure city, which is Peoria. The destination is within Illinois, so "dest" should be Illinois.

Next, the number of days is clearly stated as 7. Since it's more than 3, I need to check if there are any visiting cities mentioned. The text says three different cities in Illinois, so "visiting_city_number" will be 3.

The dates are from March 13th to March 19th, 2022. I'll format these into an array of strings with the ISO date format: ["2022-03-13", ..., "2022-03-19"].

The group consists of three people, so "people_number" is 3. The budget is $8,400, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

Now, looking at local constraints. The text mentions that accommodations must allow children under 10. That falls under "house rule." So, in the JSON, "house rule" will be set to "children under 10". The other constraints like cuisine, room type, and transportation aren't mentioned, so they'll remain null.

I should make sure all fields are filled except where it's specified that null is acceptable. Also, I need to ensure the date range covers exactly 7 days without missing any dates.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have "org", "dest", "days", "visiting_city_number", "date" array, "people_number", "local_constraint" with only "house rule" filled, and "budget". 

I think that's everything. Let me double-check each field to ensure accuracy.
