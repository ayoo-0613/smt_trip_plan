Okay, so I need to figure out how to encode the constraints from this natural language query into code. Let me read through the examples provided to understand the structure and then apply it to the new query.

The user is asking for a 7-day itinerary in Illinois starting from Peoria with three people. The budget is $8,400, and they need accommodations that allow children under 10. 

Looking at the examples, each step starts with a comment like "# Destination cities #" followed by specific instructions. I'll need to break down each part of the query into these sections.

First, destination cities: They want to visit three different cities in Illinois. So, I should run CitySearch for Illinois cities excluding Peoria if it's included. Then set variables for each city and ensure they're all unique.

Next, departure dates: The trip is from March 13th to 19th, which is 7 days. They'll have three transportations (since starting in Peoria and visiting three cities). So I need to set the departure dates accordingly.

Transportation methods: Since they don't mention flights, maybe they prefer driving? But I should allow for any method as long as it's consistent across all trips.

Flight information: Even though they might not take flights, I should still include this step in case there are flight options. Run FlightSearch and set indexes accordingly.

Driving info: If they're taking a car or using taxis, calculate the costs based on distance and number of people.

Restaurants: They need to eat three meals a day for seven days. Use RestaurantSearch to get prices and ensure they have American cuisine since that's implied by visiting Illinois cities.

Attractions: Plan one per day, so set variables and check availability in each city.

Accommodation: Need places that allow children under 10. So when setting constraints, make sure none of the accommodations have restrictions against kids.

Budget: Sum up all costs for transport, food, and stays, then ensure it doesn't exceed $8,400.

I think I've covered all parts. Now, I'll structure each step as per the examples.
