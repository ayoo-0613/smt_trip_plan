Could you create a 5-day travel itinerary for two people, leaving from Chicago and visiting 2 cities in North Carolina from March 5th to March 9th, 2022? Our budget is $3,600. We require non-shared accommodations that are pet-friendly because we will be bringing our pets. We'll not be flying and will presumably drive to the destination.
