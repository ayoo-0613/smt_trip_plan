Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me start by reading the query carefully.

The user provided a sample text: "Could you arrange a 3-day travel from Boston to San Juan, Puerto Rico, for one person between March 28th and March 30th, 2022? The budget for this trip is set to $1,400."

First, I'll identify the key components they mentioned. They want me to extract "org" (departure city), "dest" (destination), "days", "visiting_city_number", "date", "people_number", and "local_constraint". Also, there's a budget specified.

Looking at the text:
- The departure city is Boston.
- The destination is San Juan, Puerto Rico. Since it's just one city mentioned in the destination state (Puerto Rico), visiting_city_number should be 1.
- The trip spans from March 28th to March 30th, which is exactly 3 days. So "days" is 3, and the dates will be an array of those three dates.
- It's for one person, so "people_number" is 1.
- They didn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation constraints. Therefore, all local constraints should be null.

I need to make sure that each field is correctly mapped and that the JSON structure matches their examples. Also, I must ensure that if a constraint isn't mentioned, it's set to null instead of being omitted entirely, as per their instructions.

So, putting it all together, the JSON should have org as Boston, dest as San Juan, days as 3, visiting_city_number as 1, dates from March 28th to 30th, people number 1, and local constraints all null. The budget is $1400.

I think that's everything. Let me structure this into the JSON format they provided.

```json
{
    "org": "Boston", 
    "dest": "San Juan", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-28", "2022-03-29", "2022-03-30"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1400
}
```
