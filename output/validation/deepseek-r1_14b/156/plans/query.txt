Could you devise a 5-day travel itinerary for a group of 2, departing from Detroit to explore 2 cities in Wisconsin from March 1st to March 5th, 2022? Our budget is set at $3,200. We require accommodations where parties are allowed and should preferably be entire rooms. Please note that we will not be using a self-driving car; suggest other transportation modes for us.
