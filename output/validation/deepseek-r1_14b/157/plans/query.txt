Can you organize a 5-day trip for two people from Newark to Ohio, where we will visit two cities? The dates will be from March 23rd to March 27th, 2022. Our travel budget is $4,400. We anticipate hosting visitors at our accommodations, and we would like to try a variety of cuisines including French, Chinese, American, and Mexican during our trip. We prefer not to drive ourselves during this trip.
