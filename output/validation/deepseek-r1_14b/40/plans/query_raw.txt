Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the user's query starts with a request to create a 5-day travel plan. The departure city is Sun Valley, and the destination is California, specifically visiting two cities there. The dates are March 22nd to March 26th, 2022, which makes five days in total.

Looking at the JSON structure examples they provided, I see that "org" is the departure city, so that's Sun Valley. "dest" is the destination state or city; here it's California. The number of days is clearly 5, and since it exceeds 3, "visiting_city_number" should be 2 as mentioned.

The dates need to be listed in an array with each date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. So I'll convert March 22nd to 2022-03-22 and so on up to the 26th.

They mentioned a budget of $2,600, which goes under "budget". The number of people isn't specified in their text, but looking at the examples, if it's not mentioned, I should probably leave it as null or maybe assume one person? Wait, no, in the examples, when it wasn't mentioned, they left it as null. So since the user didn't specify, "people_number" will be null.

Now for the local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any of these, so all should be null. I don't see any keywords related to parties, smoking, etc., or specific cuisines, room types, or transportation restrictions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each field as per the examples, ensuring that only necessary fields are filled and others are set to null where applicable.

```json
{
    "org": "Sun Valley", 
    "dest": "California", 
    "days": 5, 
    "visiting_city_number": 2, 
    "date": ["2022-03-22", "2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25", "2022-03-26"], 
    "people_number": null, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 2600
}
```
