Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me start by reading the query carefully.

The user provided a sample text: "Please create a travel plan departing from Minneapolis and heading to Seattle for 3 days, from March 29th to March 31st, 2022, with a budget of $1,800." They also included three examples to guide the JSON structure.

First, I'll identify each required field. "org" is the departure city, which here is Minneapolis. "dest" is Seattle. The number of days is clearly stated as 3. Since days are exactly 3, visiting_city_number should be 1 because it's only the destination state, not multiple cities.

Next, I'll parse the dates. March 29th to March 31st gives me three dates: 2022-03-29, 2022-03-30, and 2022-03-31. The budget is $1,800, so that's straightforward.

Looking at "people_number," the text doesn't mention how many people are traveling. In previous examples, when not specified, it was set to null or assumed as 1 if possible. Since the user didn't specify, I'll leave it as null unless there's an implicit assumption, but based on their examples, it seems better to include it only if mentioned.

For "local_constraint," the text doesn't mention any house rules, cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions. So all these should be null. 

I need to ensure that all fields are present and correctly formatted. The date field is an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Budget is a number without commas.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key mapped appropriately. Since there's no mention of people number or any local constraints, those will be null. 

I should double-check that I didn't miss any details. Minneapolis to Seattle for 3 days in March 2022 with a budget of $1800. No other specifics are given, so the JSON should reflect only what's provided.
