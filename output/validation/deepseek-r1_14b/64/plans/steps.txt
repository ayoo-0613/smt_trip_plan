Okay, so I need to plan a 3-day trip for 7 people from Salt Lake City to Burbank, departing on March 12th and ending on March 14th, 2022. The budget is $7,600, and we want entire rooms for accommodation in Burbank.

First, I'll start by identifying the destination cities. Since the query specifies traveling from Salt Lake City to Burbank, and mentions visiting a solitary city, it seems like Burbank is the only destination. So, I'll set the cities list to include just Burbank.

Next, I need to handle the departure dates. The trip spans 3 days, so there will be two transportations: one from Salt Lake City to Burbank on March 12th and another return or maybe a stay in Burbank until March 14th. I'll set 'departure_dates' variables for these two transportations.

Transportation methods are next. The query says they don't want flights, so we're limited to self-driving or taxi. I'll set the transportation method variable for both trips and ensure that only one of those options is used.

For flight information, since flights aren't desired, I might skip this step or note that no flights are booked. But looking at the examples, they still include flight steps but assert that flight isn't taken. So I'll run FlightSearch just in case, then set 'flight_index' to -1 for both transportations.

Driving information is crucial here. I'll use DistanceSearch to get driving details from Salt Lake City to Burbank and vice versa. Then calculate the costs for self-driving or taxi based on distance and number of people (7).

Restaurant planning comes next. There are 3 days, so 9 meals in total. I need to find restaurants in both cities that offer entire rooms, but since we're only staying in Burbank, most meals will be there. I'll set 'restaurant_in_which_city' variables and ensure each meal is either in the current or next city based on transportation times.

Attractions are another consideration. We want to visit a solitary city, so maybe one main attraction in Burbank. I'll plan for 3 attractions across the days, ensuring they fit within the budget and time constraints.

Accommodation-wise, we need entire rooms for 7 people. I'll search for accommodations in Burbank that meet this requirement, check minimum nights, and calculate costs accordingly.

Finally, budgeting: sum up transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs, then ensure it doesn't exceed $7,600.
