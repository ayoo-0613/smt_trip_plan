Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully. The user is asking for a 3-day travel plan for two people traveling from Salt Lake City to Twin Falls between March 25th and March 27th, 2022. Their budget is $1,600, and they're interested in Chinese and Mexican cuisines.

Starting with the basics: "org" is the departure city, which is clearly Salt Lake City. The destination is Twin Falls, so that's "dest". The trip spans 3 days, so "days" is 3. Since the number of days doesn't exceed 3, I don't need to worry about "visiting_city_number"; it defaults to 1.

Next, the dates are March 25th to March 27th, 2022. I'll format these as an array in "YYYY-MM-DD" format: ["2022-03-25", "2022-03-26", "2022-03-27"]. The number of people is 2, so "people_number" is 2.

Looking at the local constraints: house rule isn't mentioned, nor are transportation options like no flight or no self-driving. However, they specified dining preferences for Chinese and Mexican cuisines. So, under "cuisine", I'll include both options as an array.

I need to ensure that all other fields like "house rule", "room type", and "transportation" remain null since they weren't mentioned in the text. The budget is straightforward at $1,600.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each field filled appropriately, making sure only necessary constraints are included and others are set to null as per instructions.

```json
{
    "org": "Salt Lake City", 
    "dest": "Twin Falls", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-25", "2022-03-26", "2022-03-27"], 
    "people_number": 2, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": ["Chinese", "Mexican"], 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 1600
}
```
