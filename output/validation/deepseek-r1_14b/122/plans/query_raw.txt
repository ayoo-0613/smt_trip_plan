Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. First, I'll read the example they provided to understand exactly what they're looking for.

Looking at the examples, I see that the JSON includes fields like "org" (departure city), "dest" (destination), "days", "visiting_city_number", "date", "people_number", "local_constraint", and "budget". The local constraints have four possible options: house rule, cuisine, room type, and transportation. Each of these can be null if not mentioned.

Now, let's analyze the provided text:

"Can you design a 3-day travel itinerary for 2 people, departing from Ithaca and heading to Newark from March 18th to March 20th, 2022? Our budget is set at $1,200, and we require our accommodations to be entire rooms and visitor-friendly. Please note that we prefer not to drive ourselves during this trip."

Breaking it down:

- **Departure city (org):** Ithaca
- **Destination city (dest):** Newark
- **Days:** 3 days
- **Date:** March 18th to March 20th, 2022. So the dates are 2022-03-18, 2022-03-19, and 2022-03-20.
- **People number:** 2 people
- **Budget:** $1,200

Now, looking at local constraints:

- **House rule:** The text mentions "visitor-friendly". In the options provided, "visitors" is one of the house rules. So I'll map this to "parties", but wait, no—wait, "visitor-friendly" implies they allow visitors, which corresponds to "visitors" in the list.
- **Cuisine:** The text doesn't mention any specific cuisine preferences, so this will be null.
- **Room type:** They require "entire rooms". So that's clear.
- **Transportation:** They prefer not to self-drive, so "no self-driving".

I need to make sure I'm correctly mapping each constraint. Also, since the destination is Newark, which is in New Jersey, but the example shows that if visiting multiple cities in a state, it would specify the number, but here it's just one city, so visiting_city_number is 1.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each field is correctly populated and constraints are accurately mapped.

```json
{
    "org": "Ithaca", 
    "dest": "Newark", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-18", "2022-03-19", "2022-03-20"], 
    "people_number": 2, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": "visitors", 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": "entire room", 
        "transportation": "no self-driving"
    }, 
    "budget": 1200
}
