Can you design a 3-day travel itinerary for 2 people, departing from Ithaca and heading to Newark from March 18th to March 20th, 2022? Our budget is set at $1,200, and we require our accommodations to be entire rooms and visitor-friendly. Please note that we prefer not to drive ourselves during this trip.
