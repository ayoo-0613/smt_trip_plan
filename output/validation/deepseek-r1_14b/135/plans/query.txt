Could you help me plan a 3-day trip for two people from Santa Ana to Houston between March 21st and March 23rd, 2022? We have a revised total budget of $3,000. We require accommodations that allow smoking, and we'd like our itinerary to include American, Italian, Mediterranean, and Mexican cuisines. Please consider alternative transportation options, as we do not intend to self-drive.
