Can you assist in formulating a 3-day travel plan departing from Columbus and heading to Newark, covering 1 city, from March 25th to March 27th, 2022, for 2 people? We are traveling with children under 10, so our accommodations must be suitable for them. We'd prefer entire rooms and our revised budget is set at $1,200. We're also looking for options where we don't need to self-drive.
