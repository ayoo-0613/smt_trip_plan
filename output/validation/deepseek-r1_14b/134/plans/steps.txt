Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a step-by-step plan based on the given natural language query. The user wants a 3-day travel itinerary from Columbus to Newark, covering one city, for two people. They're traveling with children under 10 and have a budget of $1,200. They don't want to self-drive.

First, I need to identify the key constraints: departure city (Columbus), destination state (New Jersey, specifically Newark), travel dates from March 25th to March 27th, two people, budget of $1,200, accommodations suitable for children under 10, preference for entire rooms, and no self-driving.

Looking at the examples provided, each step starts with a '#', so I'll follow that structure. The steps involve setting up cities, departure dates, transportation methods, gathering info on flights/driving, restaurant and attraction details, accommodation specifics, and budget tracking.

I should start by listing the destination city as Newark. Then set the departure dates for two transportations (maybe arrival and departure). Transportation methods would exclude self-driving, so only flight or taxi is allowed. Since they prefer not to self-drive, I'll focus on those options.

Next, gather flight info from Columbus to Newark for the given dates. If flights aren't available, consider taxi services. For restaurants, ensure there are options with American cuisine since that's implied by traveling in the US. Accommodation needs to be family-friendly with private rooms.

Finally, calculate the total budget by adding transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs, ensuring it doesn't exceed $1,200.
