Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the user's query is about creating a 7-day itinerary starting in Kona and visiting three cities in California. The dates are March 10th to March 16th, 2022, with a budget of $2500.

Looking at the examples, I see that "org" is the departure city, which here is Kona. The destination is California, so "dest" should be California. The number of days is clearly stated as 7, so "days": 7.

Since the trip spans more than 3 days (7 > 3), I need to check if there are any visiting cities mentioned. The text says three different cities in California, so "visiting_city_number" should be 3.

The dates need to be formatted as an array of strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. March is the third month, so that's 03. The dates from March 10th to March 16th would be ["2022-03-10", "2022-03-11", ..., "2022-03-16"].

The user mentioned it's for a group, but didn't specify the number of people. In the examples, when not specified, they left it as null or used 1 or 2 based on context. Since this is a group but no exact number is given, I'll set "people_number": null.

Looking at local constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation. The user didn't mention any specific constraints like parties, smoking, etc., nor did they specify cuisine preferences or room types. They also didn't talk about transportation restrictions beyond the dates and budget. So all local constraints should be null.

Budget is given as $2500, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field is correctly placed and follows the examples provided.

    }, 
    "budget": 2500
