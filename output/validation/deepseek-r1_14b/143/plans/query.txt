Could you help me plan a 5-day journey for a group of 6, departing from Cleveland and visiting 2 cities in Florida from March 2nd to March 6th, 2022? Our budget is now $13,900, and we require pet-friendly accommodations that should ideally be entire rooms. We are planning on bringing our pets along, so the need for pet-friendly accommodations is crucial. We would also prefer not to self-drive.
