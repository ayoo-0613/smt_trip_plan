Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to plan this 5-day trip from Cleveland to Florida for a group of 6 people. The budget is $13,900, and we need pet-friendly accommodations where we can have entire rooms. Also, we don't want to self-drive.

First, I'll start by identifying the destination cities in Florida that we can visit. Since it's a 5-day trip, we're probably looking at two main cities. I should check if there are any restrictions or preferences for specific cities in Florida.

Next, I need to handle the departure dates. We're leaving from March 2nd to March 6th, so I'll set up variables for each day of travel. This will help track when we move between cities and ensure our itinerary fits within those dates.

Transportation is another key point. Since we don't want to self-drive, we'll have to rely on flights or taxis. I should look into flight options from Cleveland to Florida and between the two cities if needed. Also, considering we're traveling with pets, I need to check if airlines allow pets or if ground transportation (like taxis) is more feasible.

For each mode of transportation, I'll gather cost estimates. Flights might be expensive for six people, so maybe a combination of flights and other options could work better. Taxis might be more flexible but could also be costly depending on the distance between cities.

Accommodation is crucial because we need pet-friendly places where we can have entire rooms. I'll search for hotels or Airbnbs in each city that allow pets and offer private rooms. It's important to book these early to ensure availability, especially during peak travel times.

Restaurants are next. We'll need three meals a day for six people over five days. I should look for places that serve American cuisine since it's not specified otherwise. Also, we might want some variety, so maybe include a mix of different dining options.

Attractions in each city will help make the trip enjoyable. I'll find popular spots or activities that are pet-friendly to ensure our pets can join us. It's important to plan these around our transportation schedule to avoid delays.

Budgeting is tight at $13,900. I need to track all expenses: flights/taxis, hotels, food, and attractions. Maybe create a spreadsheet to add up each category and make sure we don't exceed the budget.

Finally, putting it all together into an itinerary. Start with departure from Cleveland, travel to the first Florida city, spend a few days there, move to the second city, and then return. I'll need to ensure that each leg of the trip is booked and that all accommodations and activities are confirmed.

I might run into issues like finding pet-friendly flights or high costs for certain modes of transportation. If flights are too expensive, maybe consider alternative options like buses or trains if available. Also, checking the weather in Florida during March to pack appropriately for our pets.

Overall, it's a matter of breaking down each component step by step, researching each part thoroughly, and then combining them into a cohesive plan that fits within our budget and requirements.
