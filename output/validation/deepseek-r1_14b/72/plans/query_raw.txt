Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON as per their instructions. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text says: "Could you help me create a travel plan for 3 days that starts from Houston to Wichita from March 19th to March 21st, 2022? We're a group of 3 people with a budget of $2,700. Smoking is a necessity for us, so accommodating this into our hotel arrangements would be beneficial."

Starting with the basics: "org" is Houston, and "dest" is Wichita. The trip spans from March 19th to March 21st, which is exactly 3 days, so "days" is 3. Since it's a direct trip without visiting other cities in the destination state, "visiting_city_number" should be 0.

Next, the number of people is clearly stated as 3, so "people_number" is 3. The budget is $2,700, which goes under "budget."

Now, looking at local constraints. The user mentions smoking as a necessity, which falls under "house rule." So, I'll set that to "smoking." There's no mention of cuisine preferences, room type, or transportation restrictions beyond what's already covered in the trip details, so those will be null.

I need to ensure all fields are filled except where specified. The date format should be YYYY-MM-DD for each day. Also, since days don't exceed 3, visiting_city_number is correctly set to 0.

Double-checking everything: org and dest are correct, dates are formatted properly, people number and budget are accurate, and local constraints only include smoking as required. Everything else doesn't apply here.
