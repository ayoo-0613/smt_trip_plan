Okay, I need to create a detailed step-by-step instruction based on the given natural language query. The user wants a travel plan from Houston to Wichita over 3 days with specific constraints. Let me break down the problem.

First, the departure city is Houston, and the destination is Wichita. The trip starts on March 19th and ends on March 21st, so that's three days. There are three people in the group, and they have a budget of $2,700. Also, smoking is a necessity for their hotel arrangements.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each step involves encoding different aspects like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, flight information, restaurant info, attractions, accommodation, and budget constraints.

Starting with destination cities: Since they're traveling from Houston to Wichita, the only destination city is Wichita. So, I'll set the cities list to include only Wichita.

Next, departure dates: There are two transportations (departure from Houston and arrival in Wichita), so I need to set variables for these dates, ensuring the first transportation is on day 0 and the last on day 2.

Transportation methods: They don't want flights, as seen in example 3. So, they'll use either self-driving or taxi. I need to set variables for each transportation method and ensure that only one is used throughout.

Flight information: Since they're not taking flights, this section will involve running a flight search but asserting that no flights are taken by setting flight indices to -1.

Driving info: They'll be driving, so I'll calculate the costs based on distance. I need to get the driving distance and arrival times for both trips.

Restaurants: They need places to eat each day. I'll set variables for each meal and ensure they're in either the current or next city based on transportation times. Also, since there's no mention of specific cuisines, maybe just focus on availability.

Attractions: Each day should have an attraction. Again, similar to restaurants, set variables and check against current or next cities.

Accommodation: They need hotels that allow smoking. I'll search for accommodations in Wichita, ensuring each has the necessary constraints. Calculate room prices and check minimum nights.

Budget: Sum up transportation, food, and accommodation costs and ensure it doesn't exceed $2,700.

I think I've covered all aspects. Now, I'll structure each step as per the examples.
