Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract information into JSON format following specific guidelines. First, I'll read the text carefully.

The text mentions a group of 6 people traveling from Baton Rouge to Texas for a week, visiting 3 cities. Dates are March 17th to 23rd, 2022, with a budget of $14,600. They have children under ten and prefer entire rooms, not self-driving.

I need to identify each field: org is Baton Rouge, dest is Texas, days are 7 since it's a week. Visiting_city_number is 3 because they're visiting three cities in Texas. The date needs to be converted into an array from March 17th to 23rd.

People number is 6. For local constraints: house rule mentions children under ten, so that's "children under 10". Room type is entire room. Transportation is no self-driving. Cuisine isn't mentioned, so it's null.

Budget is $14,600. I'll structure all this into JSON, ensuring each field is correctly placed and constraints are accurately captured.
