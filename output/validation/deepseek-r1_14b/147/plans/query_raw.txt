Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to extract information from a given text and structure it into JSON based on specific rules they provided.

First, I'll read the example they gave to understand the expected output format. In Example 1, they extracted departure city (org), destination (dest), number of days, visiting cities, dates, people number, local constraints, and budget. The local constraints had four possible options, each with specific allowed values or null if not mentioned.

Looking at the new text provided by the user: It's a 5-day trip from Grand Junction to Arizona, visiting two cities. Dates are March 19th to 23rd, for two people, budget $2100. They want accommodations that allow visitors and prefer private rooms. Also, no flight transportation is needed.

I need to map each part of the text to the JSON fields. 

- org: Grand Junction
- dest: Arizona (since it's heading to 2 cities in Arizona)
- days: 5
- visiting_city_number: 2
- date: I'll convert March 19th to 23rd into a list of dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- people_number: 2
- local_constraint: 
   - house rule: "visitors" is mentioned, so that's the value.
   - cuisine: not mentioned, so null.
   - room type: "private room" is specified.
   - transportation: "no flight" is stated.
- budget: $2100

I should make sure each field is correctly filled and only set to null if it's not present. Also, check that the date format matches the examples.

Wait, in Example 3, they used "March 3rd to March 7th" converted into ["2022-03-03", ...]. So I'll do the same for this text.

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Now, I can structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
    "org": "Grand Junction",
    "dest": "Arizona",
    "days": 5,
    "visiting_city_number": 2,
    "date": ["2022-03-19", "2022-03-20", "2022-03-21", "2022-03-22", "2022-03-23"],
    "people_number": 2,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": "visitors",
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": "private room",
        "transportation": "no flight"
    },
    "budget": 2100
}
```
