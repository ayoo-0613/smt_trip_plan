Okay, so I need to create a step-by-step instruction based on the given natural language query about a travel plan. Let me read through the examples provided to understand how they structured their steps.

The user wants a 5-day itinerary for two people traveling from Grand Junction to two cities in Arizona between March 19th and March 23rd, 2022. The budget is $2,100, and they prefer accommodations that allow visitors with private rooms. They don't require flights.

Looking at the examples, each step starts with a '#' and follows a specific structure for different aspects like destination cities, departure dates, transportation methods, etc. I need to make sure I cover all these areas but adapt them to this query.

First, the destination cities are two in Arizona. So, I'll list possible cities and then set variables accordingly. Next, departure dates: since it's a 5-day trip with two transportations (departure from Grand Junction and arrival at the second city), I need to set those dates correctly.

Transportation methods: they don't want flights, so only self-driving or taxi. I'll set variables for that and ensure no flights are considered. Then, restaurant information—since it's for two people, I'll calculate meals per day and check cuisine preferences if any. In this case, the query doesn't specify cuisines, but maybe they just want a general approach.

Accommodation should allow visitors and have private rooms, so I need to set constraints on room type. Budget is $2,100, so I'll track transportation, restaurant, and accommodation costs separately and ensure the total stays within budget.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure each step following the examples, making sure to include all necessary details without missing any part.
