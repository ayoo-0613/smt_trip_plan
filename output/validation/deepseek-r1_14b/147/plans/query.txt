Could you help create a 5-day itinerary for a travel plan departing from Grand Junction and heading to 2 cities in Arizona from March 19th to March 23rd, 2022? It's a plan for two people with a budget of $2,100. Our accommodations should allow visitors and our preference is for private rooms. Additionally, we do not require any flight transportation.
