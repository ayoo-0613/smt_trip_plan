Alright, I need to help the user extract information from their text and structure it into JSON as per their examples. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the departure city is Seattle, so "org" will be "Seattle". The destination is San Francisco, so "dest" is "San Francisco".

The trip spans 3 days, from March 21st to March 23rd, 2022. So I'll list those dates in order under "date".

Since the user specified a 3-day trip and didn't mention visiting multiple cities within California (since San Francisco is the destination), "visiting_city_number" should be 1.

The travel is for one person, so "people_number" is 1. 

Looking at local constraints: house rules, cuisine, room type, transportation. The text doesn't mention any of these, so all will be null in the JSON.

Budget is $900, which I'll include as a number without the dollar sign.

I should make sure the date format matches the examples, using YYYY-MM-DD for each day. Also, ensure that "days" is correctly set to 3 and "visiting_city_number" is 1 since it's only San Francisco.

No other constraints are mentioned, so all local constraints remain null. Budget is straightforward at $900.

I think I've covered all the necessary fields as per the examples. Now, I'll structure this into JSON.

```json
{
    "org": "Seattle", 
    "dest": "San Francisco", 
    "days": 3, 
    "visiting_city_number": 1, 
    "date": ["2022-03-21", "2022-03-22", "2022-03-23"], 
    "people_number": 1, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
    }, 
    "budget": 900
}
```
