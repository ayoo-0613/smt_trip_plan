Unknown step type. Header: Then we have to compute the total cost (flight cost for flight legs, driving cost for non-flight legs) and also the cost of staying in the cities (which the examples don't model? Actually, the examples don't have accommodation cost. They only model transportation and maybe other costs? But the examples don't have accommodation. So we'll assume that the cost we are modeling is only transportation? But the budget is $2000, and we have to cover the entire trip. However, the examples don't model accommodation, so we'll assume that the transportation cost is the only cost we are modeling? Or the examples are incomplete?]
