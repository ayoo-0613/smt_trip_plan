We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object.
 The text: "Could you please create a 5-day travel plan for me, starting from Los Angeles and visiting 2 cities in Colorado between March 13th and March 17th, 2022? My budget for the trip is $4,700."

 Steps:
 1. "org": departure city -> "Los Angeles"
 2. "dest": destination city -> but note: the text says "visiting 2 cities in Colorado", so the destination state is Colorado. However, the example 3 uses the state as the destination (e.g., "Minnesota"). So we set "dest" to "Colorado".
 3. "days": total travel days -> 5
 4. "visiting_city_number": number of cities to be covered in the destination state -> 2 (because it says "visiting 2 cities in Colorado")
 5. "date": list of dates from March 13th to March 17th, 2022. We need to format as ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", ... "2022-03-17"]
    - Note: The example uses the format "YYYY-MM-DD", and the dates are inclusive.

 6. "people_number": The text does not specify the number of people. However, note that in the examples, if not specified, we don't have a field? But wait, the examples have "people_number" in the JSON. 
    - Looking at the examples: 
        Example 1: "a single person" -> people_number: 1
        Example 2: "for 2 people" -> people_number: 2
        Example 3: "a group of 3" -> people_number: 3
    - The given text does not mention the number of people. But note: the problem says "Other fields must have values." and we have to assign a value for "people_number". 
    - However, the examples only include "people_number" when it is specified. But the problem states: "Other fields must have values." meaning that if the field is required (like in the examples) then we must have a value. But note that the examples do not have a field for "people_number" in the JSON structure? Wait, let me check:

    Actually, in the examples, they do have "people_number". So we must include it.

    But the text does not specify the number of people. How to handle?
    - The problem says: "If neither are mentioned in the text, make the value to be null." for the local constraints, but for "people_number", it's not a constraint. 
    - However, note that the examples include "people_number" and they set it to the number mentioned. Since it's not mentioned, we cannot assume. But the problem says "Other fields must have values." meaning we cannot leave it out? But we also cannot make up a number.

    Let me re-read the problem: "Other fields must have values." -> meaning that for the fields that are required (like org, dest, days, etc.), we must have a value. But note that the examples have "people_number" as a field. However, the problem does not explicitly say that "people_number" is required to be present in the JSON. But the examples include it.

    Looking at the examples, they all have "people_number". So we must include it. But the text doesn't specify. 

    How did the examples handle when not specified? Actually, in the examples, they always specified the number of people. 

    Since the problem states: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." and for other fields we must have values, but note that "people_number" is not a local constraint. 

    However, the problem does not say that "people_number" must be non-null. It says "Other fields must have values." meaning that we cannot leave the field out? But we can set it to a default? 

    But note: the examples do not have a default. They only set it when mentioned.

    Since the text does not mention the number of people, we have to set it to null? But the problem says "Other fields must have values." and null is a value? Actually, in JSON, null is a valid value.

    However, the examples do not show a case for missing people_number. But note: the problem says "If neither are mentioned in the text, make the value to be null" only for the local constraints. For other fields, we must have a value. But what value? 

    Let me check the problem statement again: "Other fields must have values." meaning that we cannot omit the field. But we can set it to null? The problem doesn't say we can't set it to null for non-constraint fields.

    However, in the examples, they set the people_number to the number they found. Since it's not found, we set it to null? But note: the problem says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we should not assign null? 

    But wait, the problem says: "If neither are mentioned in the text, make the value to be null." only for the local constraints. So for other fields, we must have a non-null value? But we don't have the information.

    This is a dilemma. However, note that the examples provided in the problem all have the people_number specified. Since the current text does not specify, and the problem does not give a default, we have to set it to null? But the problem says "Other fields must have values", meaning we must have a value (so we cannot omit the field) but we can set it to null? 

    However, the problem also says: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we should not assign null. So we must have a non-null value? But we don't have the information.

    Let me look at the examples again: 
        Example 1: "a single person" -> people_number: 1
        Example 2: "for 2 people" -> people_number: 2
        Example 3: "a group of 3" -> people_number: 3

    Since the text does not specify, and the problem does not say to assume 1, we have to set it to null? But the problem says we can only assign null to local constraints. So we cannot set people_number to null? 

    However, note that the problem says "Other fields must have values." meaning that we must have a value (so we cannot leave the field out) but it doesn't say the value must be non-null. In JSON, null is a value. And the problem says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we are not allowed to assign null? 

    But the problem does not explicitly say that we cannot assign null to non-local-constraint fields. It only restricts the assignment of null to local constraints. So for non-local-constraint fields, we are allowed to assign a non-null value, but if we don't have the information, we might have to assign null? However, the problem says "Other fields must have values", and null is a value. So we can set it to null.

    But note: the problem says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we are not allowed to assign null? Actually, the wording is: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." -> meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we are not allowed to assign null? So we must have a non-null value for non-local-constraint fields.

    How to resolve? Since the problem does not specify the number of people, and we cannot make it up, and we are not allowed to set it to null (because it's not a local constraint and we are not allowed to assign null to non-local-constraint fields), we have a problem.

    However, note that the examples provided in the problem statement all have the people_number specified. So in the context of the problem, it is expected that the text will specify the number of people. Since it doesn't, we have to assume that the problem expects us to set it to null? But the problem says we can only assign null to local constraints.

    Let me check the problem statement again: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." -> meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we must not assign null. So we must have a non-null value. But we don't have the information.

    This is a flaw in the problem. However, note that the problem says: "Other fields must have values." and in the examples, they set the people_number to the number they found. Since it's not found, and we are forced to have a value, we have to make an assumption? But the problem doesn't say to assume.

    Alternatively, note that the problem says "Please assist me in extracting valid information", meaning we only extract what is there. So if it's not there, we don't set it? But the examples include it. 

    After re-examining the examples, I notice that the examples all have the people_number. So the problem expects it to be present. But the text doesn't have it. 

    Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says "Other fields must have values", and we cannot leave it out, and we cannot set it to null (because it's not a local constraint and we are not allowed to assign null to non-local-constraint fields), we have to set it to a default? But the problem doesn't specify a default.

    However, note that the problem says "a single person" in example 1, but that was specified. In the absence of specification, the problem might expect us to set it to 1? But that's an assumption.

    But wait: the problem says "a group of 3" in example 3, so it's not always 1. 

    Since the problem does not specify, and to avoid breaking the rule (we must have a non-null value for non-local-constraint fields), and because the problem does not say to assume, I think the intended solution is to set it to null? But the problem says we can only assign null to local constraints.

    Let me look at the examples: they don't have a case for missing people_number. So we have to decide.

    I notice that in the provided examples, the text always specifies the number of people. Therefore, in the given text, since it does not specify, we must set it to null? But the problem says we can only assign null to local constraints. So we are not allowed to set people_number to null.

    This is a conflict. However, note that the problem says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we are not allowed to assign null. So we must assign a non-null value. But we don't have the information.

    Given the instructions, I think the safe way is to set it to 1 (as a default for a single traveler) because the problem says "for me" (singular). But note: the text says "for me", which implies one person. So we can set people_number to 1.

    Why? The text: "Could you please create a 5-day travel plan for me" -> "for me" meaning one person.

    So we can infer that it's for one person.

    Therefore, we set "people_number": 1.

 7. "local_constraint": 
    - The text does not mention any of the constraints: house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation.
    - So we set all to null.

 8. "budget": $4,700 -> 4700 (without the dollar sign and comma)

 Now, let's break down the text:

   "starting from Los Angeles" -> org: "Los Angeles"
   "visiting 2 cities in Colorado" -> dest: "Colorado", visiting_city_number: 2
   "5-day travel plan" -> days: 5
   "between March 13th and March 17th, 2022" -> 
        dates: 2022-03-13, 2022-03-14, 2022-03-15, 2022-03-16, 2022-03-17 -> 5 days.

   "My budget for the trip is $4,700" -> budget: 4700

   "for me" -> people_number: 1

   No constraints mentioned -> local_constraint: all null.

 Now, construct the JSON:

 {
    "org": "Los Angeles",
    "dest": "Colorado",
    "days": 5,
    "visiting_city_number": 2,
    "date": ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 4700
 }

 Note: In the examples, the key for room type is "room type" (with a space) but in the problem statement it says "house type" in the possible options. However, in the examples, they used "room type". Let me check:

 Example 1: "room type": null
 Example 2: "room type": null
 Example 3: "room type": "entire room"

 But the problem statement says: "Possible options of 'house type' includes ...". However, in the examples, they used "room type". So we'll use "room type" as in the examples.

 Correction: The problem statement says: "Possible options of 'house type' includes ...", but in the examples, they wrote "room type". This is a typo in the problem statement. We'll follow the examples and use "room type".

 So the key is "room type", not "house type".

 Therefore, we write "room type" in the JSON.

 Let's write the JSON accordingly.
```

{
    "org": "Los Angeles",
    "dest": "Colorado",
    "days": 5,
    "visiting_city_number": 2,
    "date": [
        "2022-03-13",
        "2022-03-14",
        "2022-03-15",
        "2022-03-16",
        "2022-03-17"
    ],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 4700
}
