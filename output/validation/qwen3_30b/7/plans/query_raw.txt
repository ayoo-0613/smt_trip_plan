Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to extract information from the given text and put it into a specific JSON format. Let me read the instructions carefully.

The text provided is: "Please create a travel plan for a 3-day trip from Missoula to Dallas scheduled from March 23rd to March 25th, 2022. The budget for this trip is set at $1,900."

First, I'll break down the text to find the required fields.

"from Missoula to Dallas" – so org is Missoula, dest is Dallas.

"3-day trip" – days should be 3.

"from March 23rd to March 25th, 2022" – that's three days: 23rd, 24th, 25th. So the date array should be ["2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25"].

The budget is $1,900, so budget: 1900.

Now, checking for other fields. The examples mention "visiting_city_number" which is used when days exceed 3. Here days is 3, so visiting_city_number should be 1, as per the examples (Example 1 and 2 both have days=3 and visiting_city_number=1).

Looking at the local constraints: the text doesn't mention anything about house rules, cuisine, room type, or transportation. So all those should be null.

Wait, the examples show that when constraints aren't mentioned, they're set to null. So house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation all null.

Also, the people_number isn't mentioned in the text. Wait, in the examples, people_number is included. Let me check the examples again.

In Example 1: "a single person" → people_number: 1.

Example 2: "for 2 people" → people_number: 2.

Example 3: "a group of 3" → people_number: 3.

But in the current text, it says "a 3-day trip" but doesn't specify the number of people. Wait, the text says "Please create a travel plan for a 3-day trip..." but doesn't mention how many people. Hmm. Wait, the examples include people_number even if it's not specified? Wait, no. Wait, in Example 1, it says "for a single person", so people_number is 1. Example 2 says "for 2 people", so 2. Example 3 says "a group of 3", so 3.

But in the current text, there's no mention of the number of people. Wait, the text provided is: "Please create a travel plan for a 3-day trip from Missoula to Dallas scheduled from March 23rd to March 25th, 2022. The budget for this trip is set at $1,900."

No mention of people number. But the examples all have people_number. Wait, the problem statement says "Other fields must have values." So people_number must be present. But the text doesn't specify it. Wait, the examples include people_number even if it's not in the text? Wait, no. Wait, in the examples, the text does mention the people number. For example, Example 1 says "a single person", Example 2 says "for 2 people", Example 3 says "a group of 3".

But in the current text, there's no mention of people number. So what do I do? The problem says "Other fields must have values." So people_number must be present. But the text doesn't specify it. Wait, maybe I need to assume it's 1? But the examples don't do that. Wait, the problem statement says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed. Other fields must have values."

Wait, the fields that must have values are org, dest, days, visiting_city_number, date, people_number, budget, and local_constraint. Wait, looking at the examples, all the required fields are present. So people_number is required. But the text doesn't mention it. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem expects that if people_number isn't mentioned, we have to set it to a default? But the examples all have it specified. Wait, the problem statement says "Other fields must have values." So people_number must be present. But the text doesn't say. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again.

The text: "Please create a travel plan for a 3-day trip from Missoula to Dallas scheduled from March 23rd to March 25th, 2022. The budget for this trip is set at $1,900."

No mention of people. So how to handle this? The examples all include people_number because the text specifies it. But here, it's not specified. Wait, the problem statement says "Other fields must have values." So people_number must be present. But since it's not in the text, maybe it's a mistake. Wait, but the user provided the text, so perhaps in this case, the people_number is missing, but the problem says "Other fields must have values." So maybe I need to infer it. Wait, but the examples don't have inferred values. For example, if the text doesn't mention people, but the example requires it, maybe the problem expects that people_number is required and must be present, so perhaps in this case, since it's not mentioned, it's an error. But the user is asking to extract from the given text, so if it's not there, maybe it's supposed to be null? But the examples don't have null for people_number. Wait, looking at the examples, all have people_number set to a number. So perhaps the problem expects that people_number is always present, and if not specified, maybe it's 1? But the problem statement says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." So people_number can't be null. Wait, the problem says "Other fields must have values." So people_number must have a value. But the text doesn't specify it. Hmm. This is a problem.

Wait, maybe I misread the text. Let me check again. The text says "a 3-day trip" but doesn't say for how many people. In the examples, the number of people is specified. So perhaps in this case, the user expects that people_number is missing, but the problem requires it. Wait, but the user provided the text, so maybe it's a typo, and the text should have mentioned it. But as per the given text, it's not there. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that if people_number isn't mentioned, it's 1? But the examples don't do that. Example 1 says "single person", so people_number 1. If it's not mentioned, maybe it's 1 by default? But the problem statement doesn't say that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the examples again. Example 1: "a single person" → people_number 1. Example 2: "for 2 people" → 2. Example 3: "a group of 3" → 3. So if the text doesn't mention it, perhaps the problem expects that we can't assume, but the JSON must have it. Wait, but the problem says "Other fields must have values." So people_number must be present. Since the text doesn't specify, maybe it's an error, but I have to put something. Wait, maybe the problem expects that people_number is required, and if not specified, it's 1. But I'm not sure. Wait, the user's instruction says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed. Other fields must have values." So people_number is not a local constraint, so it must have a value. Therefore, I need to include it. But the text doesn't say. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should check if the text says "a trip" which might imply a single person, but that's a stretch. In Example 1, it says "a single person", so they specified. If it's not specified, maybe the problem expects us to leave it out, but the examples all have it. Wait, the JSON in the examples all include people_number. So the user expects it to be present. Therefore, even if the text doesn't mention it, I have to include it. But how?

Wait, maybe the problem has a mistake, but as per the instructions, I need to extract from the text. Since the text doesn't mention people_number, perhaps it's an error, but I have to put a value. Wait, but the problem says "Other fields must have values." So I have to put something. Maybe the default is 1? But I'm not sure. Wait, looking at the examples, when people_number is not mentioned, but the examples all have it. Wait, no, the examples all have it mentioned. So perhaps in this case, the text is missing people_number, but the problem expects us to include it. Wait, but the user provided the text, so maybe it's a typo, and the text should have "for 1 person" or something. But as given, it's not there.

Wait, maybe I should look at the examples again. In Example 1, the text says "a single person", so people_number is 1. In the current text, there's no such phrase, so perhaps people_number is missing. But the JSON must have it. Hmm. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that people_number is 1 if not specified. Let's check the problem statement again. It says "Other fields must have values." So people_number must be present. So I'll have to assume it's 1, even though it's not stated. Because otherwise, the JSON would be invalid. So I'll put people_number: 1.

Wait, but in Example 1, it's specified as "single person", so people_number 1. If it's not specified, maybe it's still 1. So I'll go with 1.

Now, checking all fields:

org: Missoula

dest: Dallas

days: 3

visiting_city_number: 1 (since days=3, which is not exceeding 3, so it's 1)

date: ["2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25"]

people_number: 1 (assuming)

local_constraint: all null

budget: 1900

Wait, the budget is $1,900, so 1900.

Now, check if visiting_city_number is correct. The problem says when days exceeds 3, visiting_city_number specifies the number of cities. Here days is 3, so visiting_city_number should be 1, as in the examples. So yes, 1.

Now, let's confirm the date format. March 23rd to 25th, 2022. So dates are 2022-03-23, 2022-03-24, 2022-03-25. Correct.

Local constraints: no mentions, so all null.

So the JSON should be:

{
    "org": "Missoula",
    "dest": "Dallas",
    "days": 3,
    "visiting_city_number": 1,
    "date": ["2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 1900
}

Wait, but in the examples, the local_constraint uses "room type" instead of "house type". Wait, looking at the problem statement:

"Possible options of "house type" includes ["entire room", "private room", "shared room", "not shared room"]. Possible options of "transportation" includes ["no flight", "no self-driving"]."

But in the JSON examples, it's "room type" instead of "house type". Wait, Example 1 and 2 have "room type" in the JSON. Let me check.

In Example 1's JSON:

"local_constraint": {
    "house rule": null,
    "cuisine": null,
    "room type": null,
    "transportation": null
}

Ah, so the key is "room type", not "house type". The problem statement says "house type" in the possible options, but the JSON uses "room type". So I should use "room type" as the key.

So in the JSON, it's "room type", not "house type". So the key is "room type".

So in the local_constraint, the keys are "house rule", "cuisine", "room type", "transportation".

So the JSON should have "room type" as the key.

So in my JSON, I'll use "room type" as the key.

Now, checking all fields again.

Yes, that's correct.

So the final JSON should have "room type" as the key.

Also, the problem statement says "house type" in the possible options, but the JSON uses "room type", so I'll follow the examples.

So the JSON is as above.

Now, check if all required fields are present.

org, dest, days, visiting_city_number, date, people_number, local_constraint, budget.

Yes, all present.

People_number is 1, even though not specified, but required.

So I think that's the correct JSON.
