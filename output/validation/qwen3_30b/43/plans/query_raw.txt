We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object.
 The text: "Could you help me arrange a 7-day solo travel itinerary from Kona to California with a budget of $5,800, intending to visit 3 distinct cities in California from March 7th to March 13th, 2022?"

 Steps:
 1. "org" (departure city): "Kona"
 2. "dest" (destination city): The text says "to California", but note that California is a state, not a city. However, the example 3 uses a state as the destination (Minnesota). Also, the text says "intending to visit 3 distinct cities in California", so the destination state is California. Therefore, "dest" should be "California".
 3. "days": 7 (from "7-day")
 4. "visiting_city_number": 3 (from "visit 3 distinct cities in California")
 5. "date": The dates are from March 7th to March 13th, 2022. We need to list each day as a string in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
    - March 7th, 2022 -> 2022-03-07
    - March 8th -> 2022-03-08
    - March 9th -> 2022-03-09
    - March 10th -> 2022-03-10
    - March 11th -> 2022-03-11
    - March 12th -> 2022-03-12
    - March 13th -> 2022-03-13
    So the date array will have 7 dates.

 6. "people_number": The text says "solo", meaning one person. So 1.

 7. "local_constraint": 
    - The text does not mention any house rule, cuisine, room type, or transportation constraints. 
      Therefore, all should be set to null.

 8. "budget": $5,800 -> 5800 (as a number, without the dollar sign and comma)

 However, note the example: 
   Example 1: budget is 1700 (without comma and dollar sign)
   Example 2: 1100
   Example 3: 7900

 So we convert "$5,800" to 5800.

 Now, let's check the constraints for "local_constraint":
   - house rule: not mentioned -> null
   - cuisine: not mentioned -> null
   - room type: not mentioned -> null
   - transportation: not mentioned -> null

 But note: the example 3 has "transportation": "no self-driving", but in our text there's no mention of transportation constraint.

 Therefore, the JSON should be:

 {
    "org": "Kona",
    "dest": "California",
    "days": 7,
    "visiting_city_number": 3,
    "date": ["2022-03-07", "2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", "2022-03-10", "2022-03-11", "2022-03-12", "2022-03-13"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 5800
 }

 However, note the example 3: 
   "dest" was set to "Minnesota" (a state) and not a city.

 Important: The problem states that "dest" denotes the destination city, but in the examples, when the destination is a state (like Minnesota) we use the state name. 
   In example 3: "departing from Atlanta and ending in Milwaukee" -> but wait, example 3 says "ending in Milwaukee" but the example JSON has "dest": "Minnesota". 
   Actually, the example 3 text says: "departing from Atlanta and visiting 2 cities in Minnesota", so the destination state is Minnesota.

 Similarly, in our text: "from Kona to California" and then "intending to visit 3 distinct cities in California", so the destination state is California.

 Therefore, we set "dest" to "California".

 Let's write the JSON accordingly.
