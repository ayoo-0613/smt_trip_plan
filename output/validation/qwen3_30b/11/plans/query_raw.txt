Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to extract information from the given text and put it into a specific JSON format. Let me read the instructions carefully.

The text provided is: "Please create a travel plan departing from Minneapolis and heading to Seattle for 3 days, from March 29th to March 31st, 2022, with a budget of $1,800."

First, I'll break down the key elements mentioned.

"Departing from Minneapolis" → org should be "Minneapolis".

"heading to Seattle" → dest is "Seattle".

"for 3 days, from March 29th to March 31st, 2022" → days is 3. The dates are March 29, 30, 31. So the date array should be ["2022-03-29", "2022-03-30", "2022-03-31"].

Budget is $1,800 → budget: 1800.

Now, checking the other fields. The examples show that "visiting_city_number" is used when days exceed 3. Here, days is 3, so visiting_city_number should be 1 (as per examples 1 and 2, where days=3, visiting_city_number=1).

Looking at local constraints: the text doesn't mention anything about house rules, cuisine, room type, or transportation. So all those should be null.

Wait, the examples have "people_number" in the JSON. But the text doesn't specify the number of people. Wait, in the examples, Example 1 has "a single person", Example 2 says "2 people", Example 3 says "group of 3". But in the current text, it's not mentioned. Hmm. Wait, the problem statement says "Other fields must have values." So if people_number isn't mentioned, what do I do? Wait, looking at the examples, they all include people_number. But in the given text, it's not specified. Wait, the text says "with a budget of $1,800" but no mention of people. Wait, the examples have people_number even if not specified? Wait, no. Let me check the examples again.

Example 1: "a single person" → people_number: 1.

Example 2: "2 people" → people_number: 2.

Example 3: "group of 3" → people_number: 3.

But in the current text, there's no mention of the number of people. The problem statement says "Other fields must have values." So I need to include people_number. But since it's not mentioned, what should I put? Wait, the examples all have people_number specified. But in the problem statement, it says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed. Other fields must have values."

Wait, the problem statement says "Other fields must have values." So people_number is a required field. But the text doesn't mention it. Hmm. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the text again.

Text: "Please create a travel plan departing from Minneapolis and heading to Seattle for 3 days, from March 29th to March 31st, 2022, with a budget of $1,800."

No mention of people. So how to handle this? The examples all have people_number, but in the problem statement, it's not clear if it's mandatory. Wait, the examples include people_number, so it's part of the required fields. But the text doesn't specify it. Wait, the problem says "Other fields must have values." So people_number must be present. But since it's not in the text, maybe it's a mistake. Wait, but in the examples, when it's not mentioned, they still include it. Wait, no, in the examples, it's always mentioned. Wait, Example 1 says "a single person", Example 2 says "2 people", Example 3 says "group of 3". So in the current text, since it's not mentioned, perhaps the default is 1? But the problem statement says "Other fields must have values." So maybe people_number is required, but since it's not specified, I have to assume it's 1? Wait, but the problem statement says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." So people_number is not a local constraint, so it must have a value. But the text doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "Other fields must have values." So all fields except the local constraints (which can be null) must have values. So people_number must be present. But the text doesn't mention it. Wait, maybe the problem expects that if it's not mentioned, we should set it to 1? But in Example 1, it's specified as "single person", so people_number is 1. But in the current text, since it's not specified, perhaps the default is 1. But I'm not sure. Wait, the problem statement says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed. Other fields must have values." So people_number is not a local constraint, so it must have a value. Since it's not in the text, maybe the answer expects people_number to be 1. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that if not specified, it's 1. Let me check the examples again.

In Example 1, the text says "a single person", so people_number is 1. In Example 2, "2 people", so 2. Example 3, "group of 3", so 3. So if the text doesn't mention it, perhaps it's an error, but the problem requires it. Wait, but the problem says "Other fields must have values." So I have to include people_number. Since it's not specified, maybe the answer should have people_number as 1. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the problem expects that people_number is required, and if not mentioned, it's 1. Let's proceed with that.

So people_number: 1.

Now, checking all fields:

org: Minneapolis

dest: Seattle

days: 3

visiting_city_number: 1 (since days=3, which is not exceeding 3, so it's 1 as per examples)

date: ["2022-03-29", "2022-03-30", "2022-03-31"]

people_number: 1

local_constraint: all null

budget: 1800

Wait, the examples have "visiting_city_number" only when days exceed 3. In Example 3, days=5, so visiting_city_number=2. In Examples 1 and 2, days=3, so visiting_city_number=1. So for days=3, it's 1. So here, days=3, so visiting_city_number=1.

Now, check if all required fields are present. The examples include "people_number" and "budget", which are present here.

So putting it all together.

Wait, the text says "heading to Seattle", so dest is Seattle. The destination is a city, not a state. In Example 3, dest was "Minnesota" (a state), but here it's "Seattle" (a city). So that's okay.

Now, the date format: March 29th to March 31st, 2022. So dates are 2022-03-29, 2022-03-30, 2022-03-31.

Budget is $1,800 → 1800.

Local constraints: none mentioned, so all null.

So the JSON should be:

{
    "org": "Minneapolis",
    "dest": "Seattle",
    "days": 3,
    "visiting_city_number": 1,
    "date": ["2022-03-29", "2022-03-30", "2022-03-31"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 1800
}

Wait, but in the examples, the "room type" is called "room type" in the JSON, but the problem statement says "house type" in the possible options. Wait, looking back:

"Possible options of "house type" includes ["entire room", "private room", "shared room", "not shared room"]."

But in the JSON examples, it's "room type". Wait, Example 1 and 2 have "room type" in the JSON, but the problem statement says "house type". Wait, the problem statement says:

"Possible options of "house type" includes [...]"

But in the JSON examples, it's "room type". Let me check.

In Example 1's JSON:

"local_constraint": {
    "house rule": null, 
    "cuisine": null, 
    "room type": null, 
    "transportation": null
}

Wait, the problem statement says "house type" but the JSON uses "room type". So probably a typo in the problem statement. So in the JSON, it's "room type", not "house type". So I should use "room type" as per the examples.

So the local_constraint keys are "house rule", "cuisine", "room type", "transportation".

So in the JSON, it's "room type", not "house type". So that's correct as per examples.

So the JSON should have "room type" as the key.

Now, checking if all fields are present. The examples include "people_number" and "budget", which are present here.

So the final JSON should be as above.
