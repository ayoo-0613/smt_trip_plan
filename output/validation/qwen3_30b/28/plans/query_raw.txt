We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object.
 Steps:
 1. Identify the departure city (org): "beginning in Washington" -> "Washington"
 2. Identify the destination (dest): "visiting 2 cities in Virginia" -> the destination state is Virginia, so dest: "Virginia"
 3. Days: "5-day travel plan" -> days: 5
 4. Visiting city number: "visiting 2 cities in Virginia" -> visiting_city_number: 2
 5. Date: from March 15th to March 19th, 2022 -> we need to list each day as "YYYY-MM-DD"
    - March 15, 2022 -> "2022-03-15"
    - March 16 -> "2022-03-16"
    - March 17 -> "2022-03-17"
    - March 18 -> "2022-03-18"
    - March 19 -> "2022-03-19"
    So the date array: ["2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17", "2022-03-18", "2022-03-19"]
 6. People number: The text says "for me" -> so 1 person? But note: the example 1 says "a single person", example 2 says "2 people", example 3 says "group of 3". 
    Here: "for me" -> so people_number: 1
 7. Budget: "$2,200" -> 2200 (without comma, as integer)
 8. Local constraints: 
    - The text does not mention any house rule, cuisine, room type, or transportation constraints.
    - Therefore, all local constraints should be null.

 However, note the example 1: 
   "Please help me plan a trip from St. Petersburg to Rockford spanning 3 days from March 16th to March 18th, 2022. The travel should be planned for a single person with a budget of $1,700."
   -> people_number: 1, and local_constraint: all null.

 So for our text:
   "Could you create a 5-day travel plan for me, beginning in Washington, visiting 2 cities in Virginia from March 15th to March 19th, 2022? I have a budget of $2,200 for this trip."

 We have:
   org: "Washington"
   dest: "Virginia"
   days: 5
   visiting_city_number: 2
   date: [list of 5 dates from 2022-03-15 to 2022-03-19]
   people_number: 1 (because "for me")
   budget: 2200
   local_constraint: all null

 But note: the example 3 had "visiting 2 cities in Minnesota", so dest is the state (Minnesota) and not a city.

 Important: The example 3 says "dest": "Minnesota", so we use the state name.

 However, note that in example 1: "from St. Petersburg to Rockford" -> dest is a city (Rockford). 
 But in example 3: "visiting 2 cities in Minnesota" -> dest is the state (Minnesota).

 So in our case, the text says "visiting 2 cities in Virginia", so dest is "Virginia".

 Let's write the JSON accordingly.

 Note: The example 3 also had "dest": "Minnesota", so we are consistent.

 Now, let's check the constraints: 
   The text does not mention any of the constraints (house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation). 
   So we set each to null.

 Therefore, the JSON should be:

{
    "org": "Washington",
    "dest": "Virginia",
    "days": 5,
    "visiting_city_number": 2,
    "date": ["2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17", "2022-03-18", "2022-03-19"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 2200
}

 However, note: the example 3 used "room type" (with a space) but the problem says "house type" in the description? 
 Let me check the problem statement:

 "Possible options of 'house type' includes ..."

 But in the example JSONs, they used "room type" (example 1: "room type", example 2: "room type", example 3: "room type").

 So the key in the JSON for that constraint is "room type", not "house type".

 Correction: The problem says:
   "Possible options of 'house type' includes ..."

 But in the examples, they wrote "room type". 

 Looking at the examples:

 Example 1: 
   "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
   }

 So the key is "room type", not "house type". The problem statement might have a typo.

 We'll follow the examples: use "room type".

 Therefore, we write "room type" in the JSON.

 Also note: the problem says "house type" in the description, but the examples use "room type". 
 We must use the key as in the examples.

 So the keys in local_constraint are:
   "house rule", "cuisine", "room type", "transportation"

 Now, let's write the JSON accordingly.

 Important: The problem says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." 
   Since none of the constraints are mentioned, we assign null to all.

 Also note: the problem says "Other fields must have values." and we have provided values for all.

 Let's code the JSON.
