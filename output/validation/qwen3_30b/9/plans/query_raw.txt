We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object.
 The text: "Can you help me plan a trip that begins in Sarasota and ends in Philadelphia? The trip should span over 3 days, from March 2nd to March 4th, 2022, and adhere to a budget of $2,100."

 Steps:
 1. "org" (departure city): "Sarasota"
 2. "dest" (destination city): "Philadelphia"
 3. "days": 3 (since it says "span over 3 days")
 4. "visiting_city_number": Since the trip is from Sarasota to Philadelphia (a single destination city) and days=3 (which is <=3), we set visiting_city_number to 1. 
    Note: The example says when days>3, we set visiting_city_number. Here days=3, so we set to 1 (as in examples 1 and 2).
 5. "date": The dates are from March 2nd to March 4th, 2022. We need to format as ["2022-03-02", "2022-03-03", "2022-03-04"].
    Note: The example uses two-digit month and day. So March 2nd becomes 03-02, but note: the example uses "2022-03-08" for March 8th.

 6. "people_number": The text does not specify the number of people. However, note that in the examples, if not specified, we don't have a field? 
    But looking at the examples, they all have "people_number". In example 1: "a single person", example 2: "2 people", example 3: "group of 3".
    The given text does not mention the number of people. However, the problem says: "Other fields must have values." and we have to assign a value.

    But note: the examples have "people_number" as a required field. Since it's not mentioned, we have to decide.

    However, the problem states: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed. Other fields must have values."

    But "people_number" is not a local constraint. It's a separate field. The examples have it.

    Since the text does not specify, we cannot assume. But the problem says "Other fields must have values". So we must have a value for "people_number".

    However, in the examples, they extracted the number when mentioned. Here it's not mentioned. 

    Let's check the examples: 
      Example 1: "a single person" -> people_number: 1
      Example 2: "2 people" -> people_number: 2
      Example 3: "group of 3" -> people_number: 3

    Since it's not mentioned, we have to set it to a default? But the problem doesn't say.

    However, note the problem says: "When 'days' exceeds 3, ...". It doesn't say anything about people_number.

    But the examples all have it. And the problem says "Other fields must have values". So we must have a value.

    How about we set it to 1? Because if not specified, it's common to assume one person? But the problem doesn't say.

    However, looking at the examples, they only included it when mentioned. But the problem says "Other fields must have values", meaning we cannot leave it out.

    But note: the examples provided in the problem statement all have the people_number. So we must include it.

    Since the text does not specify, and we cannot leave it out, we have to make a decision. However, the problem does not specify a default.

    Let me re-read the problem: "Other fields must have values." meaning we cannot have a missing field. But we are allowed to set to null? Only for local_constraint we can set to null.

    The problem says: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning for non-local-constraint fields, we must have a non-null value.

    Therefore, we must assign a number for people_number. Since it's not specified, and the problem doesn't give a default, we have to look for clues.

    But note: the text says "a trip" without specifying the number. In the absence of information, we cannot assume. However, the examples all had the number.

    Since the problem states that we must have a value, and the examples had it, and the text doesn't specify, we have to choose a value that is safe.

    However, the problem does not say to assume 1. But note: in example 1, they said "a single person", so they specified. Here they didn't.

    But wait: the problem says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning for other fields, we cannot assign null. So we must assign a number.

    How about we set it to 1? Because if not specified, it's often one person? But the problem doesn't say.

    However, note that the problem says: "Other fields must have values." and we are forced to have a number. So we'll set it to 1.

    But let's see: the example 1 had "a single person", so they set to 1. Without specification, we'll set to 1.

 7. "local_constraint": The text does not mention any of the constraints (house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation). So we set all to null.

 8. "budget": $2,100 -> 2100 (without the dollar sign and comma)

 Now, let's break down the text:

   "begins in Sarasota" -> org: "Sarasota"
   "ends in Philadelphia" -> dest: "Philadelphia"
   "span over 3 days" -> days: 3
   "from March 2nd to March 4th, 2022" -> date: ["2022-03-02", "2022-03-03", "2022-03-04"]
   "adhere to a budget of $2,100" -> budget: 2100

   people_number: not specified -> we set to 1 (as a safe default, because the problem requires a value and examples had it)

   local_constraint: all null.

 Now, note: the example 1 had "visiting_city_number": 1 for 3 days. So we set visiting_city_number to 1.

 Let's write the JSON:

 {
    "org": "Sarasota",
    "dest": "Philadelphia",
    "days": 3,
    "visiting_city_number": 1,
    "date": ["2022-03-02", "2022-03-03", "2022-03-04"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 2100
 }

 However, note: the example 1 used "room type" (with a space) but the problem says "house type" in the description? 
 But in the example JSON, they used "room type" (as in example 1: "room type": null). 

 Let me check the problem statement:

   "local_constraint" contains four possible constraints. 
   ... 
   Possible options of "house type" includes ... 

 But in the example JSON, they wrote "room type", not "house type". 

 Actually, in the example JSON:

   Example 1: "room type": null
   Example 2: "room type": null
   Example 3: "room type": "entire room"

 So the key is "room type", not "house type". The problem statement says "house type" but the examples use "room type". 

 We must follow the examples. So we use "room type".

 Therefore, the key for the room type constraint is "room type".

 So the JSON key for the room type constraint is "room type".

 Now, let's write the JSON accordingly.

 Important: The problem says "house type" in the description, but the examples use "room type". We'll use "room type" as in the examples.

 So the local_constraint keys are:
   "house rule", "cuisine", "room type", "transportation"

 But note: the problem says "house type" in the description, but the example JSON uses "room type". We'll use the example's key.

 Therefore, we write "room type".

 Now, let's format the JSON.

 Note: The date format must be as in the examples: "YYYY-MM-DD", with two-digit month and day.

 March 2nd -> 03-02 -> "2022-03-02"

 We have three days: March 2, 3, 4 -> so 2022-03-02, 2022-03-03, 2022-03-04.

 Let's write the JSON.
