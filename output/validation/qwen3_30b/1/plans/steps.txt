We are given a natural language query: 
"Please create a travel plan for me where I'll be departing from Washington and heading to Myrtle Beach for a 3-day trip from March 13th to March 15th, 2022. Can you help me keep this journey within a budget of $1,400?"

Let's break down the constraints:

1. Departure city: Washington (note: we assume it's the city of Washington, D.C. or the state? But the example says "departing from Washington", and in the context, it's likely a city. However, note that Myrtle Beach is a city in South Carolina. So we'll treat "Washington" as the departure city, and "Myrtle Beach" as the destination city. But note: the trip is from Washington to Myrtle Beach, and it's a 3-day trip (from March 13 to 15, so 3 days: 13,14,15). However, note that the example says "heading to Myrtle Beach", meaning Myrtle Beach is the destination. But note: the trip is only 3 days and we are going from Washington to Myrtle Beach. So we are not going to multiple cities? The example says "heading to Myrtle Beach", so the entire trip is in Myrtle Beach? But note: the departure is from Washington, so we are traveling from Washington to Myrtle Beach, and then staying in Myrtle Beach for 3 days? Actually, the trip is from March 13 to 15, so 3 days, and we are starting in Washington and ending in Myrtle Beach? But note: the trip duration is 3 days, meaning we leave Washington on March 13 and arrive in Myrtle Beach on March 13 (or 14) and then stay until March 15? However, the problem says "departing from Washington and heading to Myrtle Beach", so we are traveling from Washington to Myrtle Beach, and then the stay in Myrtle Beach is for 3 days? But note: the dates are March 13 to 15, so 3 days. However, the travel from Washington to Myrtle Beach might take one day, so the actual stay in Myrtle Beach might be 2 days? But the problem doesn't specify. We'll assume the entire trip (including travel) is 3 days, so we are traveling on the first day (March 13) and then staying in Myrtle Beach for the next two days (14 and 15) and then leaving on the 15th? But note: the problem says "3-day trip", so we'll model it as:

- Day 1 (March 13): Travel from Washington to Myrtle Beach (so we are in transit on the first day, and arrive in Myrtle Beach by the evening of March 13 or early March 14? But the problem doesn't specify travel time. We'll assume we arrive in Myrtle Beach on March 13 and then stay for two full days: March 14 and 15, and leave on March 15? Or the trip ends on March 15? Actually, the problem says "from March 13th to March 15th", meaning the stay is 3 days (13,14,15). But note: if we travel on March 13, then we have the full day of March 15? So we'll consider:

- March 13: travel day (we leave Washington, arrive in Myrtle Beach on March 13)
- March 14: full day in Myrtle Beach
- March 15: full day in Myrtle Beach (and then leave at the end of the day)

So the destination city is Myrtle Beach (one city). We are not going to multiple cities.

Therefore, we have:

- Departure city: Washington (we'll treat as a city, but note: Washington D.C. is a city, and Myrtle Beach is a city in South Carolina)
- Destination city: Myrtle Beach (only one destination city, so the trip is to Myrtle Beach and we stay there for 3 days)

But note: the problem does not specify any other cities. So we are going to Myrtle Beach and staying there.

So:

- Number of destination cities: 1 (Myrtle Beach)
- Travel days: 2 (from Washington to Myrtle Beach: one trip, so one transportation leg? Actually, the trip is a one-way from Washington to Myrtle Beach, so we have one transportation leg: Washington -> Myrtle Beach. But note: we are traveling on March 13, so we leave Washington on March 13 and arrive in Myrtle Beach on March 13 (or 14). However, for the purpose of the itinerary, we have one transportation leg (from Washington to Myrtle Beach) and then we are in Myrtle Beach for the rest of the days.

But note: the problem says "3-day trip", meaning we are in Myrtle Beach for 3 days? Actually, the travel day (March 13) is included in the 3 days. So we have:

- Day 1 (March 13): travel from Washington to Myrtle Beach (so we are in transit on March 13, but we arrive in Myrtle Beach on March 13, so we can have activities in Myrtle Beach on March 13? The problem doesn't specify. We'll assume that the arrival is by the evening of March 13, so we have one full day in Myrtle Beach on March 14 and March 15? But the problem says "from March 13 to March 15", so we count March 13 as the first day. Therefore, we have:

- March 13: travel and then evening in Myrtle Beach (so we count as day 1)
- March 14: day 2
- March 15: day 3

So we are in Myrtle Beach for 3 days (March 13,14,15) but note: we leave Washington on March 13 and arrive in Myrtle Beach on March 13 (so we have the entire day of March 13 in Myrtle Beach? Or part of the day? We'll assume we arrive in the morning of March 13, so we have the whole day of March 13 in Myrtle Beach? But the problem says "departing from Washington", meaning we leave Washington on March 13, so we might not have the whole day in Myrtle Beach? However, for simplicity, we'll model the transportation as happening on March 13, and then we are in Myrtle Beach for the rest of the trip (so March 13,14,15). But note: the problem says "3-day trip", so we are counting the travel day as day 1.

Therefore, we have:

- Transportation: one leg (Washington to Myrtle Beach) on March 13.
- Accommodation: in Myrtle Beach for 3 nights? Or 2 nights? Since we are traveling on March 13 and staying until March 15, we would have two nights (March 13 and 14, leaving on March 15). But the problem says "3-day trip", meaning 3 days and 2 nights? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the number of nights. We'll assume we stay in Myrtle Beach for 3 days (so 2 nights: March 13-14 and 14-15). But note: the problem says "from March 13 to March 15", so we are there from the beginning of March 13 to the end of March 15, which is 3 days (13,14,15). Therefore, we need accommodation for 2 nights (March 13 and 14, leaving on March 15).

However, in the examples, they model the accommodation by the number of cities (which is 1) and the minimum nights. We'll do the same.

Now, let's map to the example structure.

We note:

- The trip is to one destination city: Myrtle Beach.
- The transportation is one leg: from Washington to Myrtle Beach (so one transportation leg).
- The trip duration: 3 days (so we'll have 3 days of activities, but note: the travel day is included).

We are not given any specific requirements about cuisine, room type, etc. So we don't have to check for specific cuisines or room types. We just need to:

- Find transportation from Washington to Myrtle Beach (one way) for the travel on March 13.
- Accommodation in Myrtle Beach for 2 nights (since we arrive on March 13 and leave on March 15, so we stay 2 nights: March 13 and 14).
- We have 3 days (March 13,14,15) so we have 3 days of meals (3 meals per day * 3 days = 9 meals).

But note: the problem does not specify any constraints on cuisine or room type, so we don't have to check for specific room types or cuisines. We'll just model the cost.

So the steps:

# Destination cities # 
# Set cities to be a list includes Myrtle Beach only
# Loop through cities for 1 destination cities
# Initialize Z3 solver s
# Set 'city' variable to be indexes of 1 destination cities
# Assert 'city' variable equal to city index

# Departure dates # 
# Set 'departure_dates' variables for 1 transportation between cities (since we have one leg: Washington to Myrtle Beach)
# But note: the travel is on March 13, so we have one departure date: March 13. However, in the examples, they set the departure dates as a list of dates for the legs. Since we have one leg, we have one departure date (the date of travel). We'll set the departure date as the date of travel (March 13). The problem doesn't specify the exact time, so we'll assume we travel on March 13.

# But note: in the examples, they set the departure dates as a list of the dates for the legs. For one leg, we have one date.

# Transportation # 
# We have one transportation leg: Washington to Myrtle Beach on March 13.

# Accommodation # 
# We stay in Myrtle Beach for 2 nights (March 13 and 14), so we need to book for 2 nights.

# Meals # 
# We have 3 days (March 13,14,15) so 9 meals.

Now, let's write the steps as per the example structure.

We note: the problem does not require any specific constraints (like room type or cuisine), so we skip those steps.

So the steps in the structure:

# Destination cities #
# Set cities = ['Myrtle Beach']
# Then, the rest as in the examples.

# Transportation #
# We have one leg: from Washington to Myrtle Beach, on March 13.

# Accommodation #
# In Myrtle Beach for 2 nights.

# Meals #
# We don't have any constraints, so we just model the cost.

But note: the examples don't have any specific steps for meals beyond the count. So we'll just calculate the cost for 9 meals.

Now, we write the steps as per the example.

We'll follow the structure of the examples provided.

In the examples, they have:

- Destination cities: set to the city list.
- Departure dates: for the transportation legs.
- Transportation: the leg from the origin to the destination.
- Accommodation: for the city, for the number of nights.
- Meals: for the days.

So for this problem:

- Destination cities: Myrtle Beach (one city)
- Transportation: one leg (Washington to Myrtle Beach) on March 13.
- Accommodation: in Myrtle Beach for 2 nights (March 13 and 14, so 2 nights).
- Meals: 9 meals (3 days * 3 meals).

Now, note: the problem does not specify the origin city for transportation. We assume the origin is Washington (the departure city). So we'll have:

- Origin: Washington
- Destination: Myrtle Beach

Therefore, the steps:

# Destination cities #
# Set cities = ['Myrtle Beach']
# Then, the rest as in the examples.

# Departure dates for transportation #
# We have one transportation leg, so we need one date: March 13.
# We'll set departure_dates = ['2024-03-13'] (assuming the year is 2024, but the problem doesn't specify, so we can use the date as given).

But note: the examples don't specify the year, so we'll use the date as "March 13".

However, in the code, they might use a date format. But since this is a description, we'll write it as "March 13".

But note: the problem says "March 13th", so we'll use that.

Now, let's write the step-by-step as per the example.

We'll follow the example of the previous problems.

So:

# Destination cities #
# Set cities = ['Myrtle Beach']
# Then, we have one city, so we set the city index to 0.

# Transportation legs #
# We have one leg: from Washington (which we assume is the origin) to Myrtle Beach.
# The leg is on March 13.

# Accommodation #
# For the city Myrtle Beach, we need accommodation for 2 nights.

# Meals #
# We need meals for 3 days (March 13,14,15) -> 9 meals.

But note: the examples don't have any additional constraints (like specific room types or cuisines), so we don't have to add any constraints.

Now, we write the steps as per the required format.

We'll write:

# Destination cities #
# cities = ["Myrtle Beach"]
# city_index = 0  # since it's the first (and only) city

# Transportation legs #
# legs = [{"origin": "Washington", "destination": "Myrtle Beach", "date": "March 13"}]

# Accommodation #
# accommodation = [{"city": "Myrtle Beach", "nights": 2}]

# Meals #
# meals_per_day = 3
# total_meals = 3 * 3 = 9

But note: in the examples, they didn't calculate the total meals, they just used the count. So we'll just state the total meals as 9.

However, the problem doesn't require us to calculate the cost, only to model the itinerary. So we'll just provide the structure.

Now, note: the example of a 3-day trip to one city (like the one in the problem) would be structured as in the examples.

We'll now write the step-by-step as required.

We'll follow the format of the examples given in the problem statement.

In the examples, they had:

For a trip to multiple cities, they listed the cities and then for each city, they listed the accommodation and meals.

But for a trip to one city, it's simpler.

So the steps:

# Destination cities #
# Set cities = ["Myrtle Beach"]

# For the transportation, we have one leg from Washington to Myrtle Beach on March 13.

# For accommodation, we have one entry for Myrtle Beach for 2 nights.

# For meals, we have 9 meals.

Now, we write the steps in the required format.

We'll write:

# Destination cities #
# cities = ["Myrtle Beach"]

# Transportation legs #
# leg1 = {"origin": "Washington", "destination": "Myrtle Beach", "date": "March 13"}

# Accommodation #
# accommodation = [{"city": "Myrtle Beach", "nights": 2}]

# Meals #
# total_meals = 9

But note: the problem does not require the exact code, but the description. However, since the problem says "You are an AI that helps to plan a trip", we are to provide the structured data.

But the problem says: "You are an AI that helps to plan a trip, and you need to output the following information in a structured format."

So we'll output the structured data.

However, the problem doesn't specify the exact output format, but from the examples, we can see that they use:

{
  "destination_cities": ["Myrtle Beach"],
  "transportation_legs": [
    {"origin": "Washington", "destination": "Myrtle Beach", "date": "March 13"}
  ],
  "accommodation": [
    {"city": "Myrtle Beach", "nights": 2}
  ],
  "meals": 9
}

But note: the problem says "You need to output the following information in a structured format", and the examples in the problem statement (like the one with multiple cities) used a JSON-like structure.

So we'll output a JSON object.

But note: the problem says "You are an AI that helps to plan a trip", so we output the structured data.

However, the problem does not specify the exact keys. But from the examples, we see:

- destination_cities
- transportation_legs
- accommodation
- meals

So we'll use:

{
  "destination_cities": ["Myrtle Beach"],
  "transportation_legs": [
    {
      "origin": "Washington",
      "destination": "Myrtle Beach",
      "date": "March 13"
    }
  ],
  "accommodation": [
    {
      "city": "Myrtle Beach",
      "nights": 2
    }
  ],
  "meals": 9
}

But note: the problem says "from March 13th to March 15th", so the travel date is March 13. We assume the travel happens on March 13.

Also, note: the accommodation nights: we are staying from March 13 to March 15, so we need to be in the hotel on March 13 (for the night of March 13) and March 14 (for the night of March 14), and then leave on March 15. So 2 nights.

Therefore, the above JSON should be the output.

But wait: in the problem, the destination is "Myrtle Beach", but we are traveling to Myrtle Beach, so the destination city is Myrtle Beach. And the accommodation is in Myrtle Beach.

Also, note: the origin for transportation is "Washington", but we don't have a city named "Washington" in the destination_cities? That's okay because Washington is the departure city, not a destination. The destination city is Myrtle Beach.

So we'll output the JSON.

However, the problem does not specify the exact name of the city (Washington D.C. vs Washington state), but we'll assume it's Washington D.C. (since it's a common travel origin). But the problem says "Washington", so we'll use "Washington".

Similarly, the destination is "Myrtle Beach", which is a city in South Carolina.

So the JSON is:

{
  "destination_cities": ["Myrtle Beach"],
  "transportation_legs": [
    {
      "origin": "Washington",
      "destination": "Myrtle Beach",
      "date": "March 13"
    }
  ],
  "accommodation": [
    {
      "city": "Myrtle Beach",
      "nights": 2
    }
  ],
  "meals": 9
}

But note: the problem says "March 13th", so we'll write "March 13" without the 'th' (as in the problem statement, it says "March 13th", but in date format, we often omit the 'th').

However, to be safe, we'll write "March 13".

Now, we output this JSON.

But note: the problem says "You need to output the following information in a structured format", so we output the JSON.

However, the problem might expect a specific format. Since it's a text-based response, we'll output the JSON as a string.

So the final answer is the JSON string.

But note: the problem says "You are an AI that helps to plan a trip", so we output the JSON.

Let's write it.
```json
{
  "destination_cities": ["Myrtle Beach"],
  "transportation_legs": [
    {
      "origin": "Washington",
      "destination": "Myrtle Beach",
      "date": "March 13"
    }
  ],
  "accommodation": [
    {
      "city": "Myrtle Beach",
      "nights": 2
    }
  ],
  "meals": 9
}
```


Note: The problem does not specify the year, so we use the date as given ("March 13"). If the year is important, it would be provided, but it's not. Also, note that "Washington" is used as the origin city (likely Washington, D.C.), and "Myrtle Beach" is the destination city. The accommodation is for 2 nights (from March 13 to March 15, staying two nights: March 13 and 14). The total meals count is 3 days * 3 meals/day = 9. 

This matches the requirements of the problem.
```json
{
  "destination_cities": ["Myrtle Beach"],
  "transportation_legs": [
    {
      "origin": "Washington",
      "destination": "Myrtle Beach",
      "date": "March 13"
    }
  ],
  "accommodation": [
    {
      "city": "Myrtle Beach",
      "nights": 2
    }
  ],
  "meals": 9
}
```
