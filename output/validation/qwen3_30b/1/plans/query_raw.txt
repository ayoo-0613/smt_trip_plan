Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to extract information from the given text and put it into a specific JSON format. Let me read the instructions carefully.

First, the text provided is: "Please create a travel plan for me where I'll be departing from Washington and heading to Myrtle Beach for a 3-day trip from March 13th to March 15th, 2022. Can you help me keep this journey within a budget of $1,400?"

Looking at the examples, I need to map the text to the JSON structure. Let's break down the text.

Departure city: "Washington" – so "org" should be "Washington".

Destination: "Myrtle Beach" – so "dest" is "Myrtle Beach".

Days: "3-day trip" – so "days" is 3.

Since days is 3, which is not exceeding 3, "visiting_city_number" should be 1. Wait, the instruction says when days exceeds 3, then "visiting_city_number" specifies the number of cities. But here days is 3, so "visiting_city_number" should be 1. Wait, in Example 1, days is 3, and "visiting_city_number" is 1. So yes, for days <=3, it's 1.

Dates: from March 13th to March 15th, 2022. So the dates are 2022-03-13, 2022-03-14, 2022-03-15. So the date array should have those three dates.

Budget: $1,400, so "budget" is 1400.

Now, checking for local constraints. The text doesn't mention anything about house rules, cuisine, room type, or transportation. So all the local_constraint fields should be null.

Wait, the examples show that if not mentioned, they are set to null. So "house rule" is null, "cuisine" is null, "room type" is null, "transportation" is null.

Also, people_number: the text says "for me", which implies 1 person. So "people_number" should be 1.

Wait, in Example 1, it's "a single person", so people_number is 1. Here, "for me" would be 1 person. So people_number: 1.

Let me check the examples again. Example 1: "a single person" → people_number 1. Example 2: "2 people" → 2. Example 3: "group of 3" → 3. So here, "for me" is 1 person.

So putting it all together:

org: "Washington"

dest: "Myrtle Beach"

days: 3

visiting_city_number: 1 (since days is 3, not exceeding 3)

date: ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15"]

people_number: 1

local_constraint: all nulls

budget: 1400

Wait, the text says "Myrtle Beach" – is that the destination city? Yes, "heading to Myrtle Beach".

Check if "Myrtle Beach" is a city. Yes, it's a city in South Carolina.

Now, check if the date format is correct. The example uses "2022-03-16", so YYYY-MM-DD. So March 13th is 2022-03-13, etc.

So the date array should be three dates: 13th, 14th, 15th.

Now, check if all required fields are present. The examples include "people_number" and "budget", which are present here.

Local constraints: none mentioned, so all null.

Wait, the instruction says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed. Other fields must have values." So for local_constraint, all four are null here, which is okay.

Let me confirm the JSON structure from the examples. The examples have "local_constraint" as an object with the four keys, each set to null if not mentioned.

So the JSON should look like:

{
    "org": "Washington",
    "dest": "Myrtle Beach",
    "days": 3,
    "visiting_city_number": 1,
    "date": ["2022-03-13", "2022-03-14", "2022-03-15"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 1400
}

Wait, in the examples, "room type" is used, but the instruction says "house type" in the possible options. Wait, looking back:

"Possible options of 'house type' includes [...]". Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"Possible options of 'house type' includes [...]". But in the examples, the key is "room type". Wait, Example 1 has "room type": null. Example 2 has "room type": null. Example 3 has "room type": "entire room".

Wait, the problem statement says:

"Possible options of 'house type' includes [...]". But in the examples, the key is "room type". So probably a typo in the problem statement. The key should be "room type", as per examples.

So in the JSON, it's "room type", not "house type". So the key is "room type".

So in the local_constraint, the keys are "house rule", "cuisine", "room type", "transportation".

So the JSON should have "room type" as the key.

Therefore, the JSON should have "room type" as the key, not "house type".

So the local_constraint should have "room type": null.

Okay, that's important. So the key is "room type", as per examples.

So the JSON structure is correct as per the examples.

Now, check if all fields are present. The examples include "people_number" and "budget", which are present here.

So the final JSON should have all these fields.

Double-checking the text:

- Departing from Washington: org is Washington.

- Heading to Myrtle Beach: dest is Myrtle Beach.

- 3-day trip: days 3.

- From March 13th to 15th: dates 2022-03-13, 14, 15.

- Budget $1,400: budget 1400.

- No mention of people number, but "for me" implies 1 person.

- No local constraints mentioned, so all null.

Yes, that's all.

So the JSON should be as I outlined.
