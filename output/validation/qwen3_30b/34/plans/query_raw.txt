We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object.
 The text: "Could you put together a 5-day travel plan starting in Charlotte and visiting 2 cities in New Jersey? The dates of travel are from March 6th to March 10th, 2022, and I have a budget of $4,200."

 Steps:
 1. "org" (departure city): "Charlotte"
 2. "dest" (destination city): The text says "visiting 2 cities in New Jersey". However, note that the destination state is New Jersey, but the destination city is not specified as a single city. But the problem says: "dest" denotes the destination city. However, in the examples, when the destination is a state (like in Example 3: "Minnesota"), they put the state as the destination. But note Example 3: "departing from Atlanta and visiting 2 cities in Minnesota" -> dest: "Minnesota".

    So, in this case, the destination state is New Jersey, so we set "dest": "New Jersey".

 3. "days": 5 (from "5-day travel plan")
 4. "visiting_city_number": 2 (from "visiting 2 cities in New Jersey")
 5. "date": We have dates from March 6th to March 10th, 2022. We need to convert to ISO format: 
        March 6th -> 2022-03-06
        March 7th -> 2022-03-07
        March 8th -> 2022-03-08
        March 9th -> 2022-03-09
        March 10th -> 2022-03-10
    So the array: ["2022-03-06", "2022-03-07", "2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", "2022-03-10"]

 6. "people_number": The text does not specify the number of people. However, note that in the examples, if not mentioned, we don't have a field for people_number? But wait, in the examples, they included "people_number" when it was mentioned.

    Looking at the examples:
        Example 1: "a single person" -> people_number: 1
        Example 2: "for 2 people" -> people_number: 2
        Example 3: "a group of 3" -> people_number: 3

    In the given text, there is no mention of the number of people. So we cannot assign a value. But note the instruction: "Other fields must have values." However, the examples only included "people_number" when it was provided.

    Let's check the examples: 
        Example 1: has "people_number": 1
        Example 2: has "people_number": 2
        Example 3: has "people_number": 3

    But the problem says: "Other fields must have values." meaning that if the field is present in the examples, we must have a value. However, note that the examples also have a field "people_number" only when it was provided.

    The problem states: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed. Other fields must have values."

    But note: the examples do not have a field for "people_number" if it's not provided? Actually, in the examples, they did include it when provided. However, the problem does not say that "people_number" is mandatory. But in the examples, they included it when they had the information.

    Since the text does not mention the number of people, we cannot make it up. The instruction says: "Other fields must have values." meaning that if the field is required (like in the examples) then we must have a value. But note that the examples only included "people_number" when it was in the text.

    However, looking at the provided examples, they all have "people_number". But the problem says: "Other fields must have values." meaning that for the fields that are defined (like org, dest, days, etc.), we must have a value. But note that the examples also included "people_number" as a field. So we must include it? But the text doesn't say.

    Let me re-read the problem: "Other fields must have values." meaning that for the fields that are present in the JSON structure (like org, dest, days, etc.), we must assign a value. However, the examples show that "people_number" is included when it's provided. But the problem does not say that "people_number" is always required. 

    But note: the examples all have "people_number", so we must include it? However, the problem says: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we cannot assign null? 

    Actually, the problem states: "Other fields must have values." meaning that for the non-local-constraint fields (like org, dest, days, etc.), we must have a value. But if the text doesn't provide the number of people, then we cannot assign a value. However, the examples only included "people_number" when it was provided. So we should not include it if it's not provided? But the examples all included it because they had the information.

    However, the problem says: "Other fields must have values." meaning that if we are to include a field, it must have a value. But the examples did not include "people_number" when it wasn't provided? Actually, in the examples, they did provide it because the text provided it.

    Since the text does not mention the number of people, we have two options:
        Option 1: Omit the "people_number" field entirely.
        Option 2: Include it with a value? But we don't know.

    But note: the examples provided in the problem statement all included "people_number" because the text provided it. The problem does not say that "people_number" is a required field that must be present in every JSON. So we should only include it if we have the information.

    However, the problem says: "Other fields must have values." meaning that for the fields that we do include, they must have a value. But if we don't include the field, then it's not a problem.

    But wait: the examples all have "people_number". So the problem expects it? Actually, the problem says: "as demonstrated in the following example", and the examples have it. However, the problem does not say that "people_number" is mandatory for every trip. It's only included when the text provides it.

    Since the text does not mention the number of people, we will not include the "people_number" field? But the examples show that they included it when they had the information. So we should not include it if we don't have it.

    However, let's check the problem statement: it says "Other fields must have values." meaning that for the fields that are defined (like org, dest, days, etc.), we must have a value. But note that "people_number" is not one of the fields that are defined in the problem statement as mandatory? Actually, the problem statement lists the fields in the examples, and they included "people_number". So we must include it? But the problem does not say that.

    After re-examining the examples, they all have "people_number". So the problem expects that we include it. But the text doesn't have it. How to handle?

    Let me look at the problem again: "In the JSON, ...". The examples include "people_number". So we must have it. But the text doesn't say. 

    However, note that the problem says: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning that for non-local-constraint fields, we cannot assign null. So we cannot set "people_number" to null? Then we must have a value. But we don't have the value.

    This is a dilemma. But note: the examples only included "people_number" when the text provided it. So if the text doesn't provide it, we should not include the field? However, the problem examples all have it. But the problem does not say that the text must always have the number of people.

    Since the problem says "Other fields must have values", and if we are to include "people_number", we must have a value. But we don't. So we have two choices:

        a) Omit the field entirely (so it's not in the JSON).
        b) Include it with a value that we don't have? But we can't.

    The problem does not say that "people_number" is mandatory. So we omit it.

    However, let's compare with the examples: 
        Example 1: text says "a single person" -> included.
        Example 2: text says "for 2 people" -> included.
        Example 3: text says "a group of 3" -> included.

    So if the text doesn't say, we don't include.

    Therefore, we will not include "people_number" in the JSON.

 7. "local_constraint": The text does not mention any of the constraints (house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation). So all should be null.

 8. "budget": $4,200 -> 4200 (as integer)

 Now, let's build the JSON:

    "org": "Charlotte"
    "dest": "New Jersey"   (because it says "visiting 2 cities in New Jersey", so the destination state is New Jersey)
    "days": 5
    "visiting_city_number": 2
    "date": ["2022-03-06", "2022-03-07", "2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", "2022-03-10"]
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,   // Note: the example uses "room type", but the problem says "house type" in the constraint description. However, in the examples, they used "room type". 
        "transportation": null
    }
    "budget": 4200

 But note: the problem says for "local_constraint", the key for room type is "room type" (as in the examples) even though the problem description says "house type". The examples used "room type", so we use "room type".

 However, the problem description says: "Possible options of 'house type' includes ...", but in the examples they wrote "room type". So we follow the examples: use "room type".

 Also, note: the problem says "house type" in the description, but the examples use "room type". We'll use "room type" as in the examples.

 Now, let's write the JSON.

 Important: The problem says "visiting_city_number" specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state. Here, the destination state is New Jersey, and we are visiting 2 cities in that state.

 One more note: In Example 3, the destination was "Minnesota" (a state) and they set "dest": "Minnesota". Similarly, here we set "dest": "New Jersey".

 Let's write the JSON accordingly.

 However, note: the problem says "dest" denotes the destination city. But in Example 3, they set it to a state. So we are following the example.

 Now, the JSON:

{
    "org": "Charlotte",
    "dest": "New Jersey",
    "days": 5,
    "visiting_city_number": 2,
    "date": ["2022-03-06", "2022-03-07", "2022-03-08", "2022-03-09", "2022-03-10"],
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 4200
}

 But note: the problem says "people_number" is not included because it wasn't in the text.

 However, wait: the problem examples included "people_number" when it was provided. Since it wasn't provided, we omit it.

 But let me double-check the examples: 
    Example 1: has "people_number": 1
    Example 2: has "people_number": 2
    Example 3: has "people_number": 3

 So we are not including it because it's not provided.

 However, the problem statement does not say that "people_number" is a required field. So it's acceptable to omit.

 But note: the problem says "Other fields must have values." meaning that for the fields that we do include, they must have a value. We are not including "people_number", so we don't have to assign a value to it.

 Therefore, the above JSON is correct.

 However, note: the problem says "visiting_city_number" is only specified when "days" exceeds 3. Here, days=5 (which exceeds 3), so we include it. And we have 2 cities.

 Let's write the JSON as required.
