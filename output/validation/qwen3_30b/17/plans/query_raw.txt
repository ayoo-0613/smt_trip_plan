We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object.
 The text: "Can you help draft a 3-day travel plan, starting on March 1st, 2022 and ending on March 3rd, 2022, for one person departing from St. Louis and heading to Washington with a budget of $1,500?"

 Steps:
 1. "org" (departure city): "St. Louis"
 2. "dest" (destination city): "Washington" (note: it's a city, but note that Washington D.C. is common, but the text says "Washington", so we take as is)
 3. "days": 3 (from the text: 3-day travel plan)
 4. "visiting_city_number": Since days=3 (which is <=3), we set to 1 (as per example: when days<=3, we set visiting_city_number to 1, but note example 1 and 2 set to 1 for 3 days). However, note the example 3: when days>3 (5 days) and it says "visiting 2 cities", so for 3 days we set to 1.
 5. "date": The dates are from March 1st to March 3rd, 2022. We need to format as ["2022-03-01", "2022-03-02", "2022-03-03"].
 6. "people_number": "one person" -> 1
 7. "budget": $1,500 -> 1500 (without the dollar sign and comma)

 Now, for "local_constraint":
   - The text does not mention any house rule, cuisine, room type, or transportation constraints.
   - Therefore, all should be set to null.

 However, note the example: 
   Example 1: all constraints are null.
   Example 2: cuisine is set to ["American", "Chinese"] and others null.
   Example 3: house rule, room type, and transportation are set to specific values, cuisine null.

 So for this text, we set all constraints to null.

 Important: The example JSONs have the field "room type" (not "house type" as in the description). 
   The description says: "house type" but the examples use "room type". 
   Looking at the examples:
        Example 1: "room type": null
        Example 2: "room type": null
        Example 3: "room type": "entire room"

   So we must use "room type" (as in the examples) and not "house type".

   Also note: the description says "house type" but the examples use "room type". We follow the examples.

   Therefore, in the JSON, the key for room type is "room type".

   The constraints in the JSON should be:
        "house rule": null,   (but note: the example uses "house rule", so we use that key)
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null

   However, note the description says:
        "house rule" (with the word "rule", not "type")
        "cuisine"
        "house type" (but the example uses "room type", so we use "room type" as in the example)

   But wait: the description says:
        "Possible options of 'house type' includes ...", but the example JSON uses "room type".

   We must follow the example JSON structure. The examples use:
        "house rule": ...,
        "room type": ...,

   So we use "room type" and not "house type".

   Therefore, we have:
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null

 Now, let's build the JSON.

 Note: The text says "heading to Washington", so destination is "Washington". 
        But note: Washington is a state? However, the examples have city names (like Rockford, Milwaukee, Minnesota). 
        In example 3, the destination is "Minnesota" (a state). But in the text, it says "heading to Washington", which could be the state or the city. 
        However, the example 3 used "Minnesota" as the destination state (and then specified visiting 2 cities in Minnesota). 
        But in this text, it doesn't say "state", it just says "Washington". 

        Looking at the examples:
          Example 1: "Rockford" (a city) -> so we assume it's a city.
          Example 2: "Milwaukee" (a city) -> city.
          Example 3: "Minnesota" (a state) -> so they used the state name.

        The text says "heading to Washington". In the context of travel, Washington could be:
          - Washington, D.C. (a city) 
          - Washington state (a state)

        However, the problem does not specify. But note: the example 3 used a state name (Minnesota) and then said "visiting 2 cities in Minnesota". 
        In this text, it doesn't say "in Washington", so we assume it's a city? But the problem says "destination city", so we'll take it as a city.

        However, the example 3 destination was "Minnesota" (a state) and the problem says "dest" denotes the destination city. 
        But note: the problem says "dest" denotes the destination city. So if they say "Washington", we assume it's a city.

        But wait: the example 3 destination was "Minnesota", which is a state, but the problem says "destination city". 
        This is a bit inconsistent. However, we must follow the text.

        Since the text says "heading to Washington", and in the context of travel it's common to refer to Washington, D.C. as "Washington", we'll take it as the city.

        So "dest": "Washington"

        However, note: the example 3 had "dest": "Minnesota", so they are using the state name as the destination. 
        But the problem says "destination city", so we have a conflict.

        Let's re-read the problem: 
          "dest" denotes the destination city.

        Therefore, if the text says "Washington", we assume it's a city (like Washington, D.C.). 
        But note: the example 3 used "Minnesota" (a state) as the destination, and the problem says "destination city", so that example might be an exception? 

        However, the problem states: "In the JSON, 'org' denotes the departure city. 'dest' denotes the destination city."

        So we must treat "Washington" as a city. We'll output "Washington".

        But note: in the example 3, the destination was "Minnesota", which is a state, but the problem says "city". 
        This might be an error in the example, but we have to follow the text.

        Since the text says "heading to Washington", we'll use "Washington".

        However, to be safe, we note that the example 3 used a state name. But the problem says "city", so we'll assume that in the text, if it's a state, they might say "Washington state", but they didn't. 
        So we'll take it as a city.

        Therefore, "dest": "Washington"

 8. The date: 
        "starting on March 1st, 2022 and ending on March 3rd, 2022"
        So the dates are: 2022-03-01, 2022-03-02, 2022-03-03.

        We format as: ["2022-03-01", "2022-03-02", "2022-03-03"]

 9. "people_number": 1 (from "one person")

 10. "budget": 1500 (from $1,500 -> remove comma and dollar sign)

 Now, let's write the JSON.

 Important: The example JSONs have the field "visiting_city_number" only when days>3. Since days=3 (<=3), we set it to 1 (as in examples 1 and 2).

 But note: the problem says: "When 'days' exceeds 3, 'visiting_city_number' specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state."

 So for days<=3, we set visiting_city_number to 1 (as in the examples).

 Therefore, we set "visiting_city_number": 1.

 However, note: in example 1 and 2, they set it to 1 for 3 days.

 So the JSON structure:

 {
    "org": "St. Louis",
    "dest": "Washington",
    "days": 3,
    "visiting_city_number": 1,
    "date": ["2022-03-01", "2022-03-02", "2022-03-03"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 1500
 }

 But note: the example 1 and 2 did not have "visiting_city_number" in the example JSON? 
   Wait, let me check:

   Example 1 JSON:
        {
            "org": "St. Petersburg", 
            "dest": "Rockford", 
            "days": 3, 
            "visiting_city_number": 1,   <--- it is there
            "date": [...],
            ...
        }

   So we must include "visiting_city_number" even for 3 days.

 Therefore, we include it.

 Let's write the JSON accordingly.
