We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object as per the examples.

Text: "Can you help construct a travel plan that begins in Philadelphia and includes visits to 3 different cities in Virginia? The trip duration is for 7 days, from March 15th to March 21st, 2022, with a total budget of $1,800."

Let's break it down:

- "begins in Philadelphia" -> org: "Philadelphia"
- "includes visits to 3 different cities in Virginia" -> dest: "Virginia" (note: the destination state is Virginia, and we are visiting 3 cities within that state). So:
    - dest: "Virginia"
    - visiting_city_number: 3 (because it says "3 different cities in Virginia")
- "trip duration is for 7 days, from March 15th to March 21st, 2022" -> 
    - days: 7
    - date: we need to list each day from March 15 to March 21, 2022. Note: the example uses "2022-03-15", etc.
        - March 15 -> 2022-03-15
        - March 16 -> 2022-03-16
        - ... up to March 21 -> 2022-03-21
        - So the date array will have 7 elements: [2022-03-15, 2022-03-16, 2022-03-17, 2022-03-18, 2022-03-19, 2022-03-20, 2022-03-21]

- "total budget of $1,800" -> budget: 1800 (without the dollar sign, and as a number)

Now, check for other fields:

- people_number: not mentioned -> but note: the examples have "people_number" as a field. However, in the given text, there is no mention of the number of people. But looking at the examples, they always have a "people_number". In the examples, they were provided (e.g., "a single person", "2 people", "a group of 3"). Since it's not mentioned, we have to assign a default? But the problem says: "Other fields must have values." and we cannot leave it out.

However, note the examples: 
  Example 1: "a single person" -> people_number: 1
  Example 2: "2 people" -> people_number: 2
  Example 3: "a group of 3" -> people_number: 3

But in the current text, there is no mention of the number of people. So we have to decide.

The problem states: "Other fields must have values." meaning we cannot leave them out. But we are not given the number of people. 

Looking at the examples, they all included the people number. Since it's not provided, we have to set it to a default? However, the problem does not specify a default. But note: the examples always had it. 

Wait, the problem says: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." and for other fields, we must have values. So we must have a value for "people_number". 

But the text does not specify. How to handle?

Let me re-read the problem: "Other fields must have values." meaning we cannot have a missing field. However, the examples provided the people number. Since it's missing, we have to make an assumption? But the problem doesn't say to assume.

Alternatively, note that in the examples, the people number was always mentioned. Since it's not mentioned here, we might have to set it to null? But the problem says "Other fields must have values", meaning non-null? And the examples have numbers.

Wait, the problem says: "If neither are mentioned in the text, make the value to be null." for the local constraints. But for other fields (like people_number), it doesn't say we can set to null. It says "Other fields must have values." meaning we must assign a value (non-null). 

But we don't have the information. This is a problem.

However, note that in the examples, the people number was always provided. Since it's not provided in the current text, we have to look for a way. But the problem does not say to leave it out or set to a default.

But wait: the problem says "extracting valid information". If the information is not present, we cannot make it up. However, the problem also says "Other fields must have values." meaning we must have a value. So we are forced to set it to something.

Looking at the examples, they all had a number. The only logical thing is to set it to 1? But that's an assumption.

But note: the problem says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning for the local_constraint fields, we can set to null if not mentioned. But for other fields (like people_number), we cannot set to null. So we must set to a number.

However, the problem does not specify a default. But in the absence of information, we have to choose a value. Since the examples used 1 for single person, and the text doesn't specify, we might assume 1? But that's arbitrary.

Wait, the problem says: "Please assist me in extracting valid information". So if the information is not there, we cannot extract it. But the problem also says "Other fields must have values". This is a conflict.

Let me check the examples again: all examples had the people number. So for the purpose of this task, we must have it. Since it's missing, we have to set it to a default. The most common default in travel planning for a single person is 1? But the text doesn't say.

However, note that the problem says: "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." meaning for the local_constraint, we can set to null if not mentioned. But for people_number, it's not a local constraint, so we cannot set to null. Therefore, we must set it to a number.

Given that the examples set it to the number mentioned, and it's not mentioned, the only safe way is to set it to 1? But that's an assumption.

Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the people number is always provided. Since it's not, we have to leave it out? But the problem says "Other fields must have values", meaning we must have a field with a value.

I think the intended solution is to set people_number to 1 if not specified? But let's see the examples: they all specified.

Wait, in the provided examples, the text always included the people number. So for this text, since it's missing, we have to assume it's 1? Or perhaps the problem expects us to set it to 1.

But note: the problem says "extracting valid information", so if it's not there, we cannot extract it. However, the problem also says "Other fields must have values", so we have to put something. 

Given the constraints, I will set people_number to 1, because the examples used 1 for single person and the text doesn't specify a group.

But let's see: the text says "a travel plan", which could be for one person. So we'll set people_number: 1.

Now, for local_constraint: 
  The text does not mention any of the constraints (house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation). So we set all to null.

So the local_constraint will be:
  "house rule": null,
  "cuisine": null,
  "room type": null,   [Note: the example uses "room type", but the problem says "house type" in the description. However, in the examples, they used "room type". Let me check the examples:]

In Example 1: "room type": null
In Example 2: "room type": null
In Example 3: "room type": "entire room"

But the problem description says: "Possible options of 'house type' includes ...". However, in the examples, they used "room type". So we'll use "room type" as in the examples.

So for the JSON, we'll have "room type" (not "house type") as the key.

Now, let's compile:

- org: "Philadelphia"
- dest: "Virginia"   [because it says "in Virginia", meaning the destination state is Virginia]
- days: 7
- visiting_city_number: 3   [because it says "3 different cities in Virginia"]
- date: 
    from March 15 to March 21, 2022 -> 7 days: 
        ["2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17", "2022-03-18", "2022-03-19", "2022-03-20", "2022-03-21"]
- people_number: 1   [assumed because not specified]
- local_constraint: 
      "house rule": null,
      "cuisine": null,
      "room type": null,
      "transportation": null
- budget: 1800

But note: the problem says "visiting_city_number" specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state. Here, the destination state is Virginia, and we are visiting 3 cities in Virginia, so visiting_city_number: 3.

Now, write the JSON.

Important: The date must be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD", and we have to list each day.

Let me write the date array:

2022-03-15, 2022-03-16, 2022-03-17, 2022-03-18, 2022-03-19, 2022-03-20, 2022-03-21

Now, note: the example uses the exact format as in the examples (with leading zeros for month and day).

So the JSON:

{
    "org": "Philadelphia",
    "dest": "Virginia",
    "days": 7,
    "visiting_city_number": 3,
    "date": ["2022-03-15", "2022-03-16", "2022-03-17", "2022-03-18", "2022-03-19", "2022-03-20", "2022-03-21"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 1800
}

But note: the problem says "When 'days' exceeds 3, 'visiting_city_number' specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state." Here, days=7>3, so we have visiting_city_number=3.

Also, note that the destination is "Virginia", not a city. The examples had "Rockford", "Milwaukee", "Minnesota". So "Virginia" as a state is acceptable (like Minnesota in example 3).

Now, let's check if we missed anything:

- The text says "visits to 3 different cities in Virginia", so dest is the state (Virginia) and visiting_city_number=3.

- The budget is $1,800 -> 1800 (without the dollar sign, as a number).

- The date range: March 15 to March 21 inclusive is 7 days? 
  March 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 -> 7 days.

So the JSON above should be correct.

But note: in the examples, the destination was a city (like Rockford, Milwaukee) or a state (Minnesota). Here, Virginia is a state, so it's consistent with example 3 (which used "Minnesota" as the destination state).

Therefore, we output the JSON as above.
