We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object.
 Steps:
 1. Identify the departure city (org): "starting from Jacksonville" -> "Jacksonville"
 2. Identify the destination (dest): "visiting 2 cities in Michigan" -> the destination state is Michigan, so dest: "Michigan"
 3. Days: "5-day travel itinerary" -> days: 5
 4. Visiting city number: "visiting 2 cities in Michigan" -> visiting_city_number: 2
 5. Date: "from March 25th to March 29th, 2022" -> 
    We need to convert to ISO format: 
        March 25 -> 2022-03-25
        March 26 -> 2022-03-26
        March 27 -> 2022-03-27
        March 28 -> 2022-03-28
        March 29 -> 2022-03-29
    So the date array: ["2022-03-25", "2022-03-26", "2022-03-27", "2022-03-28", "2022-03-29"]
 6. People number: "solo trip" -> 1
 7. Budget: "$4,600" -> 4600 (without comma, as integer)

 Now, for local_constraint:
   The text does not mention any of the constraints (house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation) so we set all to null.

 However, note the example: 
   In Example 1, 2, and 3, when a constraint is not mentioned, it's set to null.

 But note: the text says "solo trip", which might imply "no parties" but the constraint for house rule is about what is allowed, not about the number of people. 
 The house rule constraints are: ["parties", "smoking", "children under 10", "pets", "visitors"]. 
 The text does not say anything about these, so we leave as null.

 Also, note that the example JSON for Example 1 has "people_number" and "budget", so we must include them.

 Let's check the required fields in the examples:
   - org, dest, days, visiting_city_number (if days>3, otherwise it's set to 1 as in Example 1 and 2), date, people_number, local_constraint, budget.

 Important: In Example 1, days=3 -> visiting_city_number=1 (because the example sets it to 1 even though the text didn't specify the number of cities? But note: Example 1 says "from St. Petersburg to Rockford", meaning one destination city. However, Example 3 says "visiting 2 cities in Minnesota", so we have to look for that phrase.)

 In our text: "visiting 2 cities in Michigan" -> so visiting_city_number: 2.

 Now, note: the example says "When 'days' exceeds 3, 'visiting_city_number' specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state." 
 Here, days=5 (which exceeds 3) so we set visiting_city_number=2.

 But note: Example 3: days=5 -> visiting_city_number=2.

 So for our text:
   org: "Jacksonville"
   dest: "Michigan"   (note: the destination state, not a city. The example 3 had "Minnesota" as dest, so we use the state name)
   days: 5
   visiting_city_number: 2
   date: [list of 5 dates from 2022-03-25 to 2022-03-29]
   people_number: 1
   local_constraint: all null
   budget: 4600

 However, note the example JSON structure: 
   In Example 3, the key for room type is "room type" (not "house type" as in the description). 
   The description says: "house type" but the example uses "room type". 
   Looking at the examples:

   Example 1: "room type": null
   Example 2: "room type": null
   Example 3: "room type": "entire room"

   So we must use "room type", not "house type".

   Also, the description says: "house type" but the example uses "room type". We'll follow the example.

   Therefore, in the local_constraint, the keys are:
        "house rule", "cuisine", "room type", "transportation"

   But note: the description says "house type" but the example uses "room type". We'll use the example's key.

   So the keys in the local_constraint object are:
        "house rule", "cuisine", "room type", "transportation"

 Now, let's write the JSON.

 Important: The text does not mention any of the constraints, so all are null.

 Let's format the JSON accordingly.

 Note: The example JSON uses "room type", so we use that.

 Also, note: the example JSON for Example 3 has "transportation": "no self-driving", but the description says "no self-driving" is a possible option. 
 However, in our text, there's no mention of transportation, so we set to null.

 Now, write the JSON:

{
    "org": "Jacksonville",
    "dest": "Michigan",
    "days": 5,
    "visiting_city_number": 2,
    "date": ["2022-03-25", "2022-03-26", "2022-03-27", "2022-03-28", "2022-03-29"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 4600
}

 But note: the example JSON uses "room type", so we use that.

 However, the problem says: "Possible options of 'house type' includes ...", but the example uses "room type". 
 We must follow the example's key names.

 Therefore, we use "room type" in the JSON.

 Let's check the examples again:

 Example 1: 
   "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null, 
        "cuisine": null, 
        "room type": null, 
        "transportation": null
   }

 So we are using "room type".

 Now, note: the text says "solo trip", which we interpret as people_number=1.

 Also, the budget: "$4,600" -> we remove the comma and convert to integer 4600.

 We are ready to output the JSON.
