We are given a text and need to extract information to form a JSON object.
 The text: "Can you create a 5-day travel plan for me starting in Sun Valley and visiting 2 cities in California from March 22nd to March 26th, 2022? My budget for this trip is $2,600."

 Steps:
 1. "org" (departure city): "Sun Valley"
 2. "dest" (destination city): The text says "visiting 2 cities in California", so the destination state is California. However, note that the example 3 uses the state as the destination (e.g., "Minnesota"). So we set "dest" to "California".
 3. "days": 5 (from "5-day travel plan")
 4. "visiting_city_number": 2 (from "visiting 2 cities in California")
 5. "date": We have the range from March 22nd to March 26th, 2022. We need to convert to ISO format: 
        March 22 -> 2022-03-22
        March 23 -> 2022-03-23
        March 24 -> 2022-03-24
        March 25 -> 2022-03-25
        March 26 -> 2022-03-26
    So the list: ["2022-03-22", "2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25", "2022-03-26"]
 6. "people_number": The text does not specify the number of people. However, note that in the examples, if not specified, we don't have a field for people_number? But wait, looking at the examples:

    Example 1: "a single person" -> "people_number": 1
    Example 2: "for 2 people" -> "people_number": 2
    Example 3: "a group of 3" -> "people_number": 3

    In the given text, it says "for me", meaning one person. So we set "people_number": 1.

 7. "local_constraint": 
        The text does not mention any constraints (house rule, cuisine, room type, transportation). 
        So we set all to null.

 8. "budget": $2,600 -> 2600 (as a number, without the dollar sign and commas)

 However, note the example JSONs: 
    Example 1: "budget": 1700
    Example 2: "budget": 1100
    Example 3: "budget": 7900

 So we output the budget as a number.

 Let's check the text again: 
    "starting in Sun Valley" -> org: "Sun Valley"
    "visiting 2 cities in California" -> dest: "California", visiting_city_number: 2
    "5-day" -> days: 5
    "from March 22nd to March 26th, 2022" -> 5 days: 22,23,24,25,26 -> 5 days.

 Now, note: the example 3 had "dest": "Minnesota", so we use the state name.

 Important: The text says "visiting 2 cities in California", meaning the destination state is California.

 But note: the example 3 says "visiting 2 cities in Minnesota", so we set dest to "Minnesota", not a city.

 Therefore, we set:
    "dest": "California"

 Now, let's write the JSON.

 However, note: the example 3 had "dest": "Minnesota", so we are consistent.

 Also, note that the text does not mention any constraints, so local_constraint will have all null.

 But wait: the example 3 had "We require accommodations that allow parties and should ideally be entire rooms." -> so they set house rule and room type.

 In our text, there is no such constraint.

 So the JSON should be:

{
    "org": "Sun Valley",
    "dest": "California",
    "days": 5,
    "visiting_city_number": 2,
    "date": ["2022-03-22", "2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25", "2022-03-26"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 2600
}

 However, note: the example 1 and 2 did not have "visiting_city_number" when days<=3? But in example 1, days=3 and they set visiting_city_number=1. 
 The problem says: "When 'days' exceeds 3, 'visiting_city_number' specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state."

 In our case, days=5 (exceeds 3) so we must have "visiting_city_number". We have 2.

 But note: the example 3 had days=5 and set visiting_city_number=2.

 So we are good.

 However, note: the example 1 had days=3 and set visiting_city_number=1. The problem says "When 'days' exceeds 3", meaning for days<=3 we don't have to set it? But the example 1 set it to 1. 

 Let me re-read: "When 'days' exceeds 3, 'visiting_city_number' specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state."

 So for days<=3, we don't have to set it? But the example 1 set it to 1. 

 Actually, the problem says: "In the JSON, ... 'visiting_city_number' specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state." and then says "When 'days' exceeds 3, ...". 

 This implies that for days<=3, we don't have a visiting_city_number? But the example 1 has it. 

 However, note the example 1: 
    "Please help me plan a trip from St. Petersburg to Rockford spanning 3 days ... "
    and they set visiting_city_number: 1.

 So the problem does not say to omit it for days<=3. It says "When days exceeds 3, ...", meaning that for days<=3, we don't have that constraint? But the example 1 included it.

 Actually, the problem states: "When 'days' exceeds 3, 'visiting_city_number' specifies ...", meaning that if days<=3, we don't have to specify it? But the example 1 did specify it as 1.

 How to resolve? 

 Looking at the examples:

 Example 1: days=3 -> visiting_city_number=1
 Example 2: days=3 -> visiting_city_number=1
 Example 3: days=5 -> visiting_city_number=2

 So it seems that regardless of days, we set visiting_city_number to the number of cities they are visiting in the destination state? 

 But note: in example 1 and 2, they are going to one city (Rockford, Milwaukee) so visiting_city_number=1.

 In example 3, they are visiting 2 cities in Minnesota.

 So the rule is: 
   "visiting_city_number" is the number of cities they are visiting in the destination state (which is the state they are traveling to, not the departure city).

 Therefore, we set it to 2 for our case.

 So we are safe.

 Now, note: the text says "visiting 2 cities in California", so we set visiting_city_number=2.

 Let's write the JSON accordingly.

 Important: The date format must be "YYYY-MM-DD", and we have 5 days: 22nd to 26th.

 We'll generate the list of dates.

 One more thing: the text says "from March 22nd to March 26th", which is 5 days (inclusive). So we have 5 dates.

 Now, let's code the JSON.

 But note: the example 3 had "dest": "Minnesota", so we use the state name "California", not a city.

 However, note: the destination state is California, so we set "dest": "California".

 But wait: the example 3 says "visiting 2 cities in Minnesota", so the destination state is Minnesota. Similarly, here the destination state is California.

 So we are good.

 Now, the JSON:

{
    "org": "Sun Valley",
    "dest": "California",
    "days": 5,
    "visiting_city_number": 2,
    "date": ["2022-03-22", "2022-03-23", "2022-03-24", "2022-03-25", "2022-03-26"],
    "people_number": 1,
    "local_constraint": {
        "house rule": null,
        "cuisine": null,
        "room type": null,
        "transportation": null
    },
    "budget": 2600
}

 However, note: the example 1 and 2 used "room type" (with a space) but the problem says "house type" in the description? 

 Let me check the problem statement:

 "Possible options of 'house type' includes ..."

 But in the example JSONs, they used "room type" (with a space) and the key is "room type" (as in the example 3: "room type": "entire room").

 So we must use the key as "room type", not "house type".

 The problem says: 
   "Possible options of 'house type' includes ..."

 But the example JSON uses "room type". 

 This is a discrepancy. However, the examples are the guide.

 In example 1, 2, 3, the key is "room type".

 So we use "room type".

 Therefore, in the local_constraint, the key for the room type constraint is "room type".

 So we write "room type" in the JSON.

 Now, let's output the JSON.

 Note: The problem says "You can only assign null to local constraints if it is needed." and we are setting all to null because not mentioned.

 Also, note: the problem says "Other fields must have values." and we have provided values for all.

 We have:
   org: "Sun Valley"
   dest: "California"
   days: 5
   visiting_city_number: 2
   date: list of 5 dates
   people_number: 1
   local_constraint: all null
   budget: 2600

 Now, write the JSON.
