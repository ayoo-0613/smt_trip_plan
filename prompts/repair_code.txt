You are fixing Python code generated by an LLM.
The code will be executed via exec() inside an existing environment.

Assume the following names already exist and MUST be used as-is:
- CitySearch, FlightSearch, AttractionSearch, DistanceSearch, AccommodationSearch, RestaurantSearch
- s (z3 Optimize), variables (dict), query_json (dict), path (str)
- generate_as_plan(...), convert_to_int(...), get_arrivals_list(...), get_city_list(...)

Your task:
- Fix the code so it executes without errors.
- Prefer minimal edits: indentation/scoping, missing definitions, typos, wrong variable names.
- Do NOT change external variable names or file paths.
- Output ONLY the corrected python code (no markdown fences, no explanation).
